When not stretching, they appear as shadowy or smokey, indistinct, rock-like shapes about 30 centimeters high.\n\nBehavior: Nobiagari ordinarily spent their time close to the ground in bamboo groves. Because of their indistinct shape and small size they blend in easily with the environment.\n\nInteractions: When a person comes face to face with a nobiagari, the nobiagari rapidly increases in height. It shoots up taller than the person, and however high they raise their head, the nobiagari always stretches higher. While the person is looking up at the nobiagari, their throat is bared. Then the nobiagari attacks.\n\nThe manner of attack varies from place to place. In Ehime, it is said that a nobiagari bites into its victim’s throat and tears it out with its sharp teeth. In Tokushima, a nobiagari wraps its elongated body around its victim’s neck and strangles them. In Kagawa, a nobiagari topples forward onto its victim and crushes them.\n\nEscape from a nobiagari is possible if a person keeps their eyes aimed downwards and refuses to look up. Kicking in an area around 30 centimeters above the ground will cause the nobiagari to disappear.\n\nOrigin: Nobiagari come from the folklore of Shikoku, and are a considered to be a variation of the yōkai mikoshi nyūdō. They are commonly believed to be the work of shapeshifting animal yōkai such as tanuki and particularly kawauso (otters). These animals are famously said to transform into giant priest yōkai like ōnyūdō and mikoshi nyūdō. This association may be partially related to the otter’s ability to stand upright on two legs, quickly changing from a small to a very tall height.\n\n",

There are a number of different words describing this phenomenon. When a person is said to have been kidnapped and taken to the other world by spirits, they are said to be a victim of kamikakushi, or spiriting away. These victims often come back to the world many years later, profoundly changed by the traumatic experience. Sometimes, however, a person never returns after going missing. In these cases, the victim is often said to have been taken–or rather eaten–by an oni. Oni hitokichi describes such a situation, where the victim was gobbled up in a single bite, never to be seen again.\n\nLegends: A famous example of oni hitokuchi appears in the Heian Period story collection Ise monogatari. Poet and playboy Ariwara no Narihira lusted after a beautiful and high ranking noble lady named Fujiwara no Takaiko. Because of the her high social status, it was impossible for them to have a legitimate relationship. To Narihira’s dismay, their affair could only be conducted in secret. Unhappy with the situation, one night Narihira snuck into Takaiko’s room and kidnapped her. He fled into the wilds with the girl, when a terrible storm struck. They discovered a cave and sheltered there. Takaiko stayed in the far back end of the cave, and Narihira stood watch by the entrance with his bow and arrow ready. In the morning, when the storm had cleared, Narihira went to retrieve Takaiko from the cave, but she was not there. An oni who lived in it had gobbled her up, and there was not even a single piece of her left. Her screams had been drowned out by the sounds of the storm during the night.\n\n",

They are larger than humans and resemble monkeys, with long, hairy manes that flow down their back.\n\nBehavior: Despite their size and strength, ijū are surprisingly shy and gentle yōkai. They mostly stay hidden away, deep in the mountains away from people. They seem to have some strange powers, but because ijū are so rare these are not well documented.\n\nInteractions: Ijū are occasionally encountered by couriers and other people who frequently travel across the mountains. Although they appear frightening, ijū do not attack people; the most they do is beg for food. In return, they sometimes offer help to people who are kind to them.\n\nOrigin: Ijū come from the folklore of Niigata Prefecture. The two best-known stories about ijū appear in Hokuetsu seppu, a 19th century book that details the daily lives of people living in Japan’s “snow country.”\n\nLegends: One summer in the village of Horinouchi, a man named Takesuke was tasked with delivering a large order of fabric to Tōkamachi—nearly 30 kilometers away across the mountains. Midway through the grueling trek, Takesuke stopped in a valley to rest and eat his lunch. Suddenly, a nearby thicket of bamboo trees parted, and a huge, hairy ijū stepped out. The ijū looked hungry and was eying Takesuke’s lunch. Takesuke split his lunch in half and offered to share a portion. The ijū happily gulped it down.\n\nTakesuke sighed with relief. He smiled at the ijū and promised it half of his lunch on the return trip as well. Then he reached for the delivery pack to continue on his journey. But before he could take it, the ijū hoisted the pack onto its shoulders and began walking ahead of Takesuke. When the village of Tōkamachi came into view, the ijū placed the delivery pack on the ground and then dashed off into the mountains as swiftly as the wind. Thanks to the ijū, Takesuke crossed the mountains without much effort.\n\nSince then, that same ijū was seen from time to time by villagers in the mountains, sometimes stopping at their homes to ask for food.\n\nAnother tale tells of a girl from Tōkamachi with such skill at the loom that wholesalers would request her weaving by name. One winter while she was home alone weaving, an ijū appeared just outside of her window. The girl was terrified, but because she was strapped into her loom she was unable to run away. However, the ijū did not appear threatening. Instead, it was hungrily staring at the rice cooking on her stove.\n\nThe girl slowly extricated herself from the loom, then went over to her stove and made several rice balls. She offered them to the ijū, who happily ate them and then scampered off into the mountains. From then on, whenever the girl was weaving alone, the ijū would emerge from the mountains and beg for food. She gradually became used to its presence, and no longer feared it.\n\nOne day, a rush order for fabric came from a very high ranking customer. It specifically requested the girl’s weaving. However, the girl’s period had just begun that day; and because menstruation was considered unclean, it was taboo for her to work. If she waited until she was able to work again, the deadline would be missed.\n\nOn the third day, her family left her home alone and went to work in the fields. Once again, the ijū appeared. The girl offered it some cooked rice which it happily ate as usual, but this time the ijū seemed to sense the girl’s anguish for her desperate situation. Instead of leaving immediately after eating like it usually did, the ijū sat down and seemed to concentrate or to medidate for a time. Then, it stood up and ran back into the mountains.\n\nThat night, the girl’s period miraculously ended. Astonished, she quickly purified herself and worked all night long to finish the order. In the morning, her father rushed to the wholesaler with the order. Everything was delivered it on time. Then, as soon as the payment for the order was made, the girl’s period began once again. Thanks to the ijū, the girl was able to complete her order.\n\n",

They tend to be small and frail, and cannot do heavy jobs with their frog strength. As long as their disguise remains undiscovered, kaeru nyōbō and their human partners can potentially have many happy years together. However, there is a high risk of discovery and subsequent disaster—if a husband ever grows suspicious of his wife and happens to see her transform into frog form, the marriage will come to a tragic end.\n\nOrigin: Stories about frog brides are found all over Japan. Although the minor details vary from region to region and story to story, they often contain similar themes and follow similar patterns, such as a frog priest being struck by a rock. The following kaeru nyōbō legend comes from the folklore of Yamagata Prefecture.\n\nLegends: Long ago an old man and his son lived together in extreme poverty. The old man often said, “Even though we’re so poor, if any woman was willing to marry my son—anybody at all—I don’t care who they are, they would be welcome!” But since they were so poor, no woman ever came.\n\nBut then one day, a strange thing happened. A young woman appeared at the door. She said, “Excuse me, but if anybody would do, would you take someone like me as a bride?”\n\nThe old man was delighted. “Come in! Come in! No woman has ever come to our home before. But I’ve always said that if anybody was willing to marry my son, anybody would do. And I think you’ll do just fine!”\n\nThe old man and his son welcomed the woman into their home. She was sopping wet from head to toe—strange, they thought, as it hadn’t rained for days. But they sat her by the fire to dry off anyway. She was extremely short—no larger than a child of three or four years. She was so small that she couldn’t do any heavy housework; although she was willing to perform any chore that was light enough for her. But the old man and his son had said that anybody would do, and they thought she was good enough.\n\nOne day, the woman needed to return to her family to attend a memorial service for her father. Although they were poor, the old man and his son scraped together a small bag of rice for her to bring to her family as a gift. They placed the sack of rice on the woman’s back, but the weight was too much for her to bear and she was squashed flat. The two men scooped rice out of the bag until it contained just 5 cupfuls, after which the bride returned to her normal shape and stood up. She was able to carry the smaller load, albeit with some difficulty. She thanked them for the gift and left the house. But the old man was suspicious of the young woman’s severe frailty. He instructed his son to follow her to see what kind of place she came from.\n\nThe woman traveled across town, then deep into the mountains. Her husband followed from a distance, and thought it very strange, as there were no homes that far up the mountain. Finally, she stopped at the edge of a marsh. She looked left, then right, and then plop! She jumped into the water. The young man rushed towards the edge of the marsh. He couldn’t see her anywhere in the dark water. He leaned in close to the water and listened. The only sound was the croaking of frogs… but they seemed to be speaking!\n\n“What happened? How come you’re so late? We’ve been waiting a long time for you!”\n\n“I know… It’s because I had to carry this rice! They gave me a whole bag of rice, and it squashed me flat. I couldn’t get here any faster.”\n\n“Anyway, the priest is already here. Let’s begin the memorial service.”\n\nThe sound of frogs croaking out Buddhist prayers filled the air. The young man was repulsed. He had been tricked into marrying a frog! He picked up a rock and hurled it into the water. There was a big splash, and the croaking stopped. The man left the pond and returned home. He told his father everything.\n\nLate that night, the woman returned to her husband’s home. “I’m sorry it took so long!” she said as she entered the house.\n\n“How was the memorial service?” asked the old man.\n\n“Oh wow… well it started out fine. But then a huge rock fell from the sky and hit the priest on the head—right in the middle of his prayers! It was a huge mess!”\n\nThe young man shouted at his bride. “What are you saying? You’re a frog! I saw everything! It was I who threw the rock!”\n\n“You saw me?!” The girl was mortified. She covered her face in embarrassment. Then she transformed back into a frog and, croaking, hopped out the door. They never saw her again.\n\nAnd that’s why in marriage you must never say that anybody at all will do.\n\n",

Their details vary from place to place and legend to legend.\n\nInteractions: Like most dragons, kuzuryū have power over rain and water. Shrines dedicated to them are usually organized around praying for rain and for the health of nearby rivers, and for protection from floods.\n\nOrigin: Kuzuryū legends can be found all over Japan. In some places, the worship of nine-headed dragon gods predates recorded history, while others are more recent. In Buddhism, nine-headed dragons are often associated with Washukitsu Ryūō (Sanskrit: Vāsuki), a many headed dragon who heard the teachings of the Buddha and gave up his evil ways. As Buddhism spread throughout Japan, many kuzuryū legends came to be viewed as local manifestations of Washukitsu.\n\nLegends: The Togakushi Shrine in Nagano Prefecture is home to a famous kuzuryū legend. In 849 CE, a monk named Gakumon took up residence in a cave on Mount Togakushi. As he recited the Lotus Sutra, a fearsome kuzuryū appeared before him. The dragon told him that he was once the steward of a nearby temple, but he stole the donations made to the temple and kept them for himself. His sin caused him to transform into a dragon. As he listened to Gakumon’s recitations, he finally achieved enlightenment. The dragon pledged to remain in the cave and protect the area, and Gakumon sealed the cave’s entrance with a boulder. After that, the dragon blessed the land with rain and water. He was also especially good at curing toothaches for anyone who left him an offering of his favorite food: pears.\n\nThe Hakone Shrine in Kanagawa tells of a kuzuryū who lived in Lake Ashi. For years it tormented the villagers of Hakone by summoning storms and making the lake dangerous for boats. Every year the villagers selected a young girl to offer up as a sacrifice to appease the venomous nine-headed dragon who lived in the lake. In 757 CE, a priest named Mangan heard of these human sacrifices and went to save the people of Hakone. He bound the serpent to an upside-down cedar tree at the bottom of the lake and preached Buddhist teachings until it repented. The kuzuryū apologized for its evil deeds and promised to forever be a protective spirit of the lake. It offered three precious artifacts—an orb, a scepter, and a jug—to the people, and Mangan established a shrine honoring the kuzuryū.\n\nThe Kuzuryū River, which flows from Mount Haku through Fukui Prefecture is named for a nine-headed dragon who lives at the mountain’s peak. In 717 CE, a monk named Taichō made a pilgrimage to the summit of Mount Haku. While meditating beside Midorigaike Pond, a holy dragon with nine heads emerged from the water. The kuzuryū revealed itself to be an avatar of the Shintō goddess Izanami, while Taichō recognized it as a manifestation of the eleven-faced Kannon, a Buddhist goddess of mercy. Soon after, Taichō established the Hakusan Faith and built the temple Heisenji. In 889 CE, a nine-headed dragon appeared before a congregation of priests at Heisenji. The dragon was seen in the river, carrying a statue of itself downstream. After that, the river came to be known as the Kuzuryū River.\n\n",

            "content": "大嶽丸\nおおたけまるTranslation: a nickname meaning “great mountain peak”\n\nAppearance: Ōtakemaru is a kijin—an oni so powerful and so violent that he is considered both demon (ki) and god (jin). He lived in the Suzuka Mountains on the border of Ise and Ōmi Provinces during the reign of Emperor Kanmu (781 to 806). Although his legend is not so well-known today, he was once considered among the most fearsome yōkai in Japanese history. Along with Shuten dōji and Tamamo no Mae, he is often considered one of the Nihon san dai aku yōkai, or Great Three Evil Yōkai of Japan. (Some versions of this ranking replace Ōtakemaru with Sutoku Tennō.)\n\nOrigin: Because of the time period and locations in which his story takes place, and the fact that his chief enemy was the shōgun Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, it is thought that Ōtakemaru may be a folkloric interpretation of Aterui, a chieftain of the Emishi people of northeastern Japan who waged a devastating campaign against the Yamato Japanese. His legend also serves as the basis of Aomori Prefecture’s famous Nebuta Matsuri, in which large floats depicting warriors defeating oni are parading through the streets.\n\nLegends: Long ago an oni named Ōtakemaru terrorized travelers in the Suzuka Mountains and stole tributes intended for the emperor in Kyōto. The emperor commanded his shōgun, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro, to exterminate the demon. Tamuramaro raised an army of 30,000 horsemen and entered the Suzuka Mountains. However, Ōtakemaru was powerful, and using his black magic he summoned a great storm. He covered the mountains in black clouds, making it impossible to see. Rains and winds battered the army. Lightning crashed and fire rained down from the sky onto the army. For seven long years Tamuramaro and his men roamed the mountains in search of Ōtakemaru, but could not catch him.\n\nThe Suzuka Mountains were home to a tennyo—a beautiful goddess named Suzuka Gozen. When Ōtakemaru saw her, he was enchanted by her beauty and became determined to spend a night in her company. He transformed himself into a beautiful young man, a noble of the court, and other disguises, and night after night traveled to Suzuka Gozen’s palace. But every time, his solicitations were denied by the goddess.\n\nFrustrated by his inability to find the Ōtakemaru’s whereabouts, Tamuramaro prayed to the gods and the buddhas to help him. That night, as he dozed off, he had a vision of an old man. “To defeat Ōtakemaru you must gain the help of Suzuka Gozen,” the old man told him. Tamuramaro sent his army of 30,000 horsemen back to Kyōto and climbed the Suzuka Mountains by himself. Deep in the mountains, he came upon a palace in which lived a beautiful woman. She invited him inside, and he spent the night with her. The woman told Tamuramaro, “I came down from heaven to help you defeat the demon who haunts these mountains. I will capture him for you.” Tamuramaro realized that this beautiful woman must be Suzuka Gozen.\n\nSuzuka Gozen led Tamuramaro through the mountains to show him the Ōtakemaru’s demon castle. She instructed him that Ōtakemaru could be defeated while he possesses the Sanmyō no ken (Kenmyōren, Daitōren, and Shōtōren: three holy swords of great power). Then they traveled back to her palace, where she laid her trap for the oni.\n\nThe night, Ōtakemaru came to her again, disguised as usual as handsome young man to ask for her love. Suzuka Gozen invited him inside, and said to him: “A warrior named Tamuramaro is coming here to kill me. Please, lend me the Sanmyō no ken so that I may defend myself.” The oni gave her Daitōren, and Shōtōren to defend herself with, but kept Kenmyōren for himself.\n\nThe following night Ōtakemaru came once again to Suzuka Gozen’s palace. Tamuramaro was waiting for him there. Ōtakemaru revealed his true form to the shōgun, transforming into a massive demon who stood over 10 meters tall, with eyes that shined like the sun and the moon. A terrible combat ensued. Heaven and earth shook with the fury of their battle. Ōtakemaru attacked Tamuramaro with sword and spear, but the shōgun was a holy warrior, protected by the thousand-armed Kannon, bodhisattva of mercy, and Bishamonten, god of war. Ōtakemaru split his body into thousands of oni, who charged at Tamuramaro. Tamuramaro took from his quiver a single holy arrow and fire it, The arrow split into one thousand arrows which in turn split into ten thousand more and impaled the oni in their faces, killing them. Just then, Ōtakemaru made a ferocious lunge at Tamuramaro. But the shōgun was faster, and he swung his blade Sohaya at the oni’s head, lopping it off.\n\nTamuramaro brough the oni’s head back to Kyoto for the emperor to inspect. The emperor was so pleased with the shōgun that he granted him Iga Province as a reward. Tamuramaro returned to Iga, married Suzuka Gozen, and the two of them lived happily together for many years.\n\nŌtakemaru’s reign of terror, however, was not over. His spirit traveled to India for a time, and eventually returned to Japan and haunted Kenmyōren. He was able to reform his body and once again became a kijin. He rebuilt his impregnable demon castle on Mount Iwate in Mutsu Province and once again he began to terrorize Japan.\n\nTamuramaro and Suzuka Gozen traveled to Mutsu to meet their nemesis one more time and defeat him once and for all. While Ōtakemaru was away from his castle, Tamuramaro snuck in through a secret back door that Suzuka Gozen had revealed to him in Ōtakemaru’s first demon castle. When Ōtakemaru returned, Tamuramaro was waiting for him. They did battle, and once again Tamuramaro cut Ōtakemaru’s head clean off. The oni’s head flew up into the air and landed upon Tamuramaro’s head and bit down hard. Fortunately, Tamuramaro was wearing two helmets. Though the demon head bit off and swallowed the first one, Tamuramaro was able to escape injury. Ōtakemaru’s head was once more taken back to Kyōto, where it was locked safely away in the treasury of Byōdōin.\n\n",

Their facial expressions show gentle, motherly kindness.\n\nBehavior: Chīnouya live in rivers near graveyards where children are buried. They emerge from the water to look after the spirits of dead children, nourishing them in the afterlife with their milk. When they appear on land, they usually haunt a specific tree and only ever appear near it.\n\nInteractions: Because chīnouya watch over of the spirits of dead children, when a child under six years old dies, it is customary to ask them to look after the spirits of the deceased by leaving multi-tiered boxes of food at the graveyard as an offering.\n\nDespite their kind appearance and motherly nature, chīnouya can be very dangerous. Their nurturing has the opposite effect if the subject is a living child, quickly causing them to weaken and die. When children wander too close to the water where a chīnouya lives, the chīnouya will pull them down into the depths and drown them.\n\nBecause mirrors resemble the shiny, reflective water’s surface, on islands where chīnouya are found, young children are kept away from mirrors. It is believed that children who look at mirrors will be drawn to water, and might wander too close to the water where a chīnouya lives.\n\nOrigin: Chīnouya come from the folklore of Yanbara, the forested, northern part of Okinawa Island. Child-rearing spirits like them are found all over Japan and share many similarities. North of Okinawa Prefecture, spirits like ubume and kosodate yūrei are well-known examples. Within Okinawa, many islands have their own local variations, such as the chīanmē from Kouri Island. A chīanmē stares, forlorn, towards one direction and foretells the death of a child. It is believed a child will die within one week in whatever village lies in the direction the chīanmē stares.\n\nLegends: In the village of Ōgimi on Okinawa Island, a young couple gave birth to their second child. He was healthy for several months, but then he fell seriously ill. His parents, grandparents, and relatives all gathered and took turns caring for the boy day and night. Finally, the baby’s strength returned and he started to look better. Then, one night, a hemp palm in the front of the house began to glow eerily. The door to the baby’s room was open a crack, and the mother peered in. She saw a woman with long hair and enormous breasts smiling at her baby and telling him to come to her. Then she vanished. The mother screamed for help and rushed into the boy’s room, but it was already too late. The baby was unresponsive, and his body was growing cold.\n\n",

His body is said to be 1000 ri long (an ancient unit of distance which varies quite a bit from age to age and place to place)—an immeasurable distance, meaning that he is impossibly large. He lives at the foot of Mount Shō, near the northern sea. His eyes glow like beams from a lighthouse, and his breath is so strong that it changes the seasons.\n\nBehavior: When Shokuin opens his eyes, day falls upon the earth. When he closes them, it becomes night. When he inhales it becomes summer. When he exhales it becomes winter. Shokuin does not need to eat, drink or breathe to survive, but when he does decide to breathe it causes huge gusts of wind.\n\nOrigin: Shokuin originally comes from China. Shokuin is the Japanese pronunciation of the characters that make up his name; in China he is known as Zhuyin or Zhulong. Many yōkai were lifted straight from Chinese by Japanese authors—some of them more or less word for word, others undergoing quite a bit of a transformation and reinterpretation, depending on how much liberty the authors decided to take. Toriyama Sekien’s description of Shokuin doesn’t undergo too much of a change from his source: the Sengaikyō (Chinese: Shanhaijing), an encyclopedia of fantastical Chinese mythological creatures. However, Shokuin appears in a number of other Chinese books, many of which contain contradictory statements about precisely where he lives and other details about him. It isn’t clear where exactly his home of Mount Shō is located, but Toriyama Sekien describes it as being near the Arctic Ocean.\n\nDue to his size and the effects that his blinking and breathing has on the day/night and seasonal cycles, Shokuin may have been an ancient Chinese solar or fire deity, or even a personification of the sun. It has also been suggested that Shokuin may have been the aurora borealis. An ancient Chinese name for the northern lights was “red spirit,” and the location of Shokuin far to the north further supports this theory. To the ancient Chinese, the aurora may have looked like a giant red dragon thousands of kilometers long writhing across the northern sky.\n\n",

They carry walking sticks and wear straw raincoats on top of over-sized baby clothes.\n\nBehavior: Konaki jijii get their name from their distinctive habit of crying like babies. They usually hide in the mountains near roads and trails, and when a human passes within earshot, they begin to scream and cry like a human baby.\n\nInteractions: A konaki jijii’s crying often evokes sympathy in those who hear it. A person who passes by a konaki jijii and tries to comfort it is in for a nasty surprise. When they hug the crying spirit, it rapidly becomes heavier and heavier. The konaki jijii clings to its victim, who is unable to pull themself free. They are inevitably crushed to death under its increasing weight.\n\nOrigin: Konakijijii comes from the mountain folklore of Tokushima Prefecture. It is thought to be a yōkai that was invented by combining two different folktales into a new form. One tale tells of a mountain-dwelling yōkai that mimics a baby’s cry and crushes to death any who try to pick it up. This pattern of behavior—tricking passersby into helping a crying baby and then crushing them like a stone—is shared by several yōkai across Japan, such as obariyon, ubume, and nure onna. The other tale tells of an old man—who supposedly actually existed—who walked around mimicking a baby’s cry. He was disliked by the locals, and parents would warn children that if they didn’t behave, he would come and get them. Some folklorists believe these local superstitions mixed together and eventually wound up as the yōkai called konaki jijii.\n\n",

Hitsu no Saishō was the nickname of Fujiwara no Arikuni, a Heian period noble who lived from 943-1011 CE.\n\nLong ago, during a period of great movement of culture and ideas between China and Japan, a government minister named Karu no Daijin was sent on a diplomatic mission to Tang China. He never returned, and his family in Japan, including his young son, Hitsu no Saishō, were left not knowing even knowing whether he was alive or dead.\n\nMany years later, when Hitsu no Saishō was an adult, he traveled to China to search for news of his missing father’s whereabouts. He traveled far and wide, and in a particular location he came across something he had never seen before: a a candlestick fashioned out of a living human being! The man had been installed like a piece of furniture onto a fancy platform, and a large candle had been affixed to his head. Every inch of his body was covered in strange tattoos. And by some combination of strange drugs and sorcery, the man’s throat had been blocked up and ability to speak had been removed.\n\nAs Hitsu no Saishō looked in amazement at the strange creation, the tōdaiki began to shed tears. Unable to speak, the man bit hard into his finger tip until it began to bleed. Then, using his finger, he wrote out a poem in his blood:\n\nLong ago I came to China from Japan. I have the same family name as you.\nThe bond between father and son transcends even the seas and mountains that have separated us.\nFor years I have cried in this horrible place. Every day I think of my parents.\nI have been transformed into this candlestick in this faraway land. I just want to go home.Upon reading this, Hitsu no Saishō realized in horror that the tōdaiki was his own father whom he had come to China looking for!\n\n",

            "content": "竜王\nりゅうおうTranslation: dragon king, nagaraja\n\nAppearance: Ryūō are dragon kings from Buddhist cosmology who gave up their evil ways and have dedicated their lives to helping humans reach spiritual enlightenment. Although ryūō are dragons, they are usually depicted in human form or in a hybrid human-serpent form rather than in a traditional dragon form.\n\nThe most famous ryūō are the hachidai ryūō—the eight great dragon kings who were present when the Buddha gave the Lotus Sutra and converted to Buddhism.\n\nBehavior: Ryūō are powerful, fearsome dragons with connections to water and the power to control rain. In return for renouncing evil and following the Buddha, they have been set free from the torments that plague other dragons, such as being preyed upon by karura. They live in great underwater palaces where they collect treasures—especially Buddhist relics and texts. They have god-like powers, and are worshiped by farmers, fishers, and others who rely on water for their livelihood.\n\nOrigin: Japanese dragons are a complex mixture of several cultural traditions. Ryūō are based on the nagaraja—snake kings of Indian mythology—which were adapted into Buddhism. As Buddhism spread from India into East Asia, India’s naga merged with China’s long, and absorbed many aspects of Chinese folklore and religion. In Japan they further mixed with existing Japanese snake and dragon cults. Due to centuries of religious syncretism, dragons with Chinese or Indian origins and those with Japanese origins can be difficult to distinguish. Some came to be viewed as different incarnations of the same being. However, there are also many Shintō and Buddhist dragons which resemble one another yet are considered to be separate individuals.\n\nLegends: Eight ryūō were present when the Buddha delivered the Lotus Sutra, along with several other supernatural beings including ten, yasha, kendatsuba, ashura, karura, kinnara, and magoraka. Together with the ryū, these eight races are known as the hachibushū—the eight legions. They were so impressed by the Buddha’s teachings that they converted, pledging themselves to be guardians of Buddhism. While they have the appearance and ferocity of demons, they are actually benevolent warrior gods.\n\nNanda (Sanskrit: Ānanda; bliss) is the highest ranking of the dragon kings. He is the older brother of Batsunanda (Sanskrit: Upananda, meaning wholesome bliss). These brothers are both highly revered as gods of the winds and rains. They are the target of worship in Shō’u kyōhō, a Buddhist prayer for rain and for protection from floods and other natural disasters.\n\nShagara (Sanskrit: Sāgara; ocean) is the dragon king of all the ocean. He lives in a great palace at the bottom of the sea called Ryūgū. He is the father of Zennyo Ryūō, a benevolent dragon goddess of rainmaking who appears in several Buddhist legends.\n\nWashukitsu (Sanskrit: Vāsuki; many heads) is a many-headed dragon who is associated with Kuzuryū, a nine-headed Japanese serpent god. In Indian mythology, he used his long body like a rope to help the gods churn the cosmic ocean of milk. This produced a number of fantastic substances, including the nectar of immortality which the gods drink in order to maintain their long lives and wisdom.\n\nTokushaka (Sanskrit: Takshaka; poisonous gaze) possesses a deadly poison. He can kill a person simply by staring at them, although he uses this power to fight evil spirits rather than hurt people. He is the father of Kisshōten, a goddess of happiness, fertility, and beauty.\n\nAnabadatta (Sanskrit: Anavatapa; heat free) is the most virtuous of all the dragon kinds. He is a god of cool, clear water who lives in a lake in the north of the Himalayas. He provides the land with clean water from the top of the world by sending it down the four great rivers: Ganges, Indus, Amu Darya, and Tarim.\n\nManashi (Sanskrit: Manasvin; large body) is a big dragon with a strong sense of compassion. When the ashura attacked the emperor of heaven’s palace with seawater, he used his large body to push the water back into the sea.\n\nUhatsura (Sanskrit: Utpalaka; blue lotus) lives in a beautiful pond where blue lotus flowers bloom. He observes all of the deities of the land and helps them regulate the rains and winds in order to bring about good harvests.\n\n",

Those who burn the incense will see the spirits of the dead within the smoke.\n\nOrigin: Hangonkō is made from the hangonjū, a magical tree with leaves and flowers that resemble those of a maple or Japanese oak. Its smell can be picked up from over 100 ri away. To make hangonkō, you steam the hangonjū’s roots until the sap comes out. Then you knead the sap to make the incense. Even a small piece of this resin is strong enough to recall the spirits of those who died from sickness or disease. There is a catch, however. Hangonkō only returns the spirit for a short time, and they only exist within the smoke of the burning incense.\n\nLegends: The incense was famously used by Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty in China. After his beloved concubine Li Furen passed away, the emperor fell into deep depression. A Taoist sorcerer, in an attempt to ease the emperor’s grief, provided him with a bit of hangonkō so that he might see Lady Li one more time.\n\nHangonkō was a popular subject in Japanese literature as well. It appears in a number of Edo period works, from ghost story books to theater, kabuki, rakugo, and bunraku. The Japanese versions star different characters connected to famous Japanese figures; for example in one story a man is overcome with grief at the death of his beloved prostitute, and a hōkan—a male geisha—recommends he try summon her using a secret incense handed down by the onmyōji Abe no Seimei.\n\nAll of the variations of the story share the same moral: after the person uses the incense to meet their lover’s spirit, it only leaves them sadder and more grieved than they were before. Hangonkō doesn’t alleviate their loneliness, it makes it worse. This story is an allegory. Smoke can be a symbol of delusion, such as attachment to the material world, or the inability to let go of a loved one after death. In Buddhism, this delusion is the ultimate cause of all suffering. The smoke of this incense prevents people from properly letting go of their loved ones and moving on. They’re stuck in the past, in a delusion, and will be forever miserable unless they learn to let go.\n\n",

They had long, sharp claws and ferocious faces. Generally, they were thought to look like wolves, dogs, tanuki, or even weasels or cats. Far more fanciful forms existed too. Sometimes raijū were said to look like little dogs, but with four rear legs and two tails. Sometimes they were said to look like insects or crustaceans. Others looked like miniature dragons. Even more exotic raijū were said to be chimerical monsters composed of many different animals.\n\nBehavior: Raijū live in the sky—a world which was totally off limits to humans before the 20th century. Because of this, almost nothing can be said about their true nature or behavior. They ride bolts of lightning to earth when thunder claps, and create mayhem wherever they land. For seemingly no reason at all they attack buildings, starting fires and causing mass destruction.\n\nInteractions: Long ago, raijū were seen as divine beasts, akin to the thunder gods (raijin). Nothing was known about them except that they were fast, merciless, and deadly. Whenever lightning struck, people believed that a raijū had been sent by the gods to punish them for some reason or another.\n\nSmall raijū like burrow into humans’ belly buttons to hide from angry thunder gods. This is the origin of a Japanese superstition which says to cover your belly button when you hear thunder.\n\nOrigin: Long ago the raijū was one of the most well known and most feared supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore. Yet today it is relatively minor, and practically unknown to the average person. This drastic reversal is due to advances in science during the 19th and 20th centuries. In the Edo period and earlier, lightning and other natural disasters were believed to be the work of the gods. Only gods had the power to shake the earth and send fire from the sky. Lightning strikes so quickly and so randomly that it is impossible to observe. But it has very observable effects: the terrible booms that shake the ground, the odd burn patterns on the things it strikes, and the fires that it ignites. In old Japan when buildings were all made of wood and closely packed together, a single lightning strike could cause a lot of destruction. The damage caused by lightning was indiscriminate—it destroyed everything from peasant hovels to imperial palaces. Lightning was rightly feared by all.\n\nDuring the Edo period, “real” raijū were popular sideshow attractions, along with kappa and mermaids. Mummified and taxidermined remains of cats, monkeys, and dogs were presented as raijū and toured around the country in traveling shows. Viewers could pay a few coins to get a safe, up-close look at a dead raijū in a glass case.\n\nDuring the Meiji period, society was rapidly transformed due to the influx of foreign science and technology. Yōkai like raijū were one of the first victims of this modernization. People were actively discouraged from holding on to superstitions because they were perceived as an embarrassment to the country. New understandings about electricity and lightning, and the invention of the airplane explained away the raijū’s most defining features—its life in the unreachable sky, and the god-like power of lightning. Once those mysteries were gone, the raijū had no more power over peoples’ imaginations, and so it was quickly forgotten.\n\nLegends: Because they were so scary, raijū are usually presented in stories as beasts to be slain, like oni. The most famous example is probably the nue, which attacked Kyōto and was slain by Minamoto no Yorimasa in 1153. Another legend involves the samurai Tachibana Dōsetsu. One night he was taking shelter from a storm under a tree when lightning struck. He drew his sword just in time to strike the bolt. When the smoke had cleared, there was a dead raijū on the ground next to him. Afterwards, he named his sword Raikiri, or “lightning cutter.”\n\n",

Their most defining feature is their wrinkly old face caked with thick, sloppy, white face powder.\n\nInteractions: Oshiroi babā don’t interact with humans too often.

They come out when nobody is around and play with the shells, flipping them over and moving them around into different positions.\n\nOrigin: Kaichigo’s origins lie in kaiawase (“shell matching”), a popular Heian period game which uses painted seashells. Beautiful shells of the right size and color were collected and decorated, their insides lined with gold and painted with scenes from popular stories, such as The Tale of Genji. The two halves of the same shell would be painted with the same scene, and players of the game would try to match the two sides. Beautifully decorated shell boxes, or kaioke, were used to store the shells while not in use.\n\nKaiawase gradually became replaced by other matching games, such as karuta, which use less exquisite playing pieces. The kaioke and shells themselves came to be viewed as precious art objects instead of toys. Because each shell half will perfectly fit its matching half and no other, expensive kaiawase sets came to be used as wedding dowries—symbolizing a perfect and unique match between bride and groom. Some boxes have been passed down from mother to daughter over and over for centuries. Those kaioke which have been around for a very long time and are no longer used as games begin to resent their existence. They grow restless and want to be played with once again, and develop a soul: the kaichigo.\n\n",

They are fond of mischief, loved by all, and believed to bring great fortune and riches to those whose houses they haunt. Direct sightings of these spirits are rare. It is often difficult to make out any details other than a vague, child-like shape. When they can be seen, zashiki warashi appear as ghostly children, five or six years old and with blushing red faces. The boys are dressed in child-sized warrior costumes and the girls in patterned kimonos and with hair that is either short and bobbed or long and tied back. In rare stories they appear as wild, hairy, brutish figures. It is said that only children and the house’s owners are able to see these spirits. They are usually known only by their pranks.\n\nBehavior: Zashiki warashi love mischief. Often the first signs that one’s house may be inhabited is by a trail of children’s footprints going through ashes or soap powder. Other mischief includes making phantom noises. These noises sound like children’s games—tops spinning all night long, paper crinkling, children’s voices, or kagura—Shinto holy music. Most hauntings involve a single zashiki warashi, while some involve multiple spirits.\n\nInteractions: Zashiki warashi are considered guardian spirits of the house, and gods of luck. It is said that a house with a zashiki warashi will prosper and grow rich, and a house that drives away such a spirit will fall into decline and ruin. In one account, a family witnessed a zashiki warashi leaving their home, and soon they all succumbed to food poisoning and died. In another well-known legend from Iwate Prefecture, a wealthy man’s son shot a zashiki warashi with a bow and arrow. Soon after the family’s fortunes collapsed.\n\nIn many homes, these spirits befriend the children of the house, teaching them songs, games, and nursery rhymes. They keep elderly or infertile couples company, and these couples often treat the zashiki warashi as if it were their own child. The desire to attract and keep these friendly yōkai has led to customs like setting out food in the zashiki for them, and even laying coins in the foundation when building a new house. The Japanese take great care to maintain their formal reception room so as not to drive out any guardian spirits dwelling there.\n\nOther forms: Their common name comes from the zashiki, the formal reception room for guests in a Japanese house where these spirits most often reside. Zashiki warashi are known by many different names in other areas, such as kura bokko or “warehouse child,” and makura gaeshi, or “pillow turner.” Countless variations of zashiki warashi exist across Japan, with minor differences in their appearance and behavior.\n\n",

            "content": "安倍晴明\nあべのせいめいAppearance: Abe no Seimei is perhaps the most famous onmyōji in Japanese history. A descendent of the famous poet Abe no Nakamaro, he lived from 921 to 1005 CE. Due to his success as an astrologer and diviner, he was widely believed to be a genius—and a wielder of magical powers and secret knowledge.\n\nOrigin: Abe no Seimei’s fame comes from the success he had as an onmyōji in the 10th century. He was a student of Kamo no Tadayuki and Kamo no Yasunori, and succeeded Yasunori as astrologer and diviner for the imperial court. Seimei’s duties included foreseeing the gender of unborn babies, diving the location of objects, advising on matters of personal conduct, conducting exorcisms and crafting wards against dark magic and evil spirits, and analyzing and interpreting events such as celestial phenomena. He wrote numerous books on divination and fortune telling, including Senji Ryakketsu, containing six thousand forecast and thirty-six fortune telling techniques using shikigami, and a translation of Hoki Naiden, detailing secret divination techniques.\n\nAbe no Seimei was so renowned that the Abe family remained in control of the Bureau of Onmyō until it was shut down in 1869. After his death, stories about Seimei began to spread rapidly and continued to do so for hundreds of years. Eventually, the details of his life became so intertwined with countless legends that the truth was no longer distinguishable from myth.\n\nLegends: It was believed that Abe no Seimei’s magical aptitude derived from a supernatural lineage. His mother was said to be a kitsune, making him half-yōkai. Seimei’s father, Abe no Yasuna, saved a white fox which was being chased by hunters. The fox transformed into a beautiful human woman and said her name was Kuzunoha. Out of thanks for saving her life, Kuzunoha became Yasuna’s wife and bore him a son, Seimei.\n\nBy age five, Abe no Seimei’s yōkai lineage was becoming apparent. He was able to command weak oni and force them to do his bidding. One day, he witnessed his mother in her fox form. Kuzunoha explained to Seimei that she was the white fox his father once saved. She then fled into the forest, never to return again. Kuzunoha entrusted her son to the onmyōji Kamo no Tadayuki in order to ensure that he would not grow up to be evil.\n\nAbe no Seimei had many rivals. One of them was a famous priest from Harima named Chitoku Hōshi. Chitoku was a skilled sorcerer, and wanted to test Seimei to see if he was truly as great as people said he was. Chitoku disguised himself as a traveler and visited Seimei’s house, and asked Seimei to teach him magic. Seimei saw through the disguise instantly. Even more, he saw that the two servants Chitoku had brought with him were shikigami—summoned servant spirits—in disguise.\n\nSeimei decided to have a little bit of fun with Chitoku. He agreed to train him, but said that it was not a good day, and that he should come back tomorrow. Chitoku went back to his home, while unbeknownst to him, Seimei unsummoned both of the shikigami. The next day, Chitoku realized that his servants were gone, and he approached Seimei to ask him to return his shikigami. Seimei laughed at him, angrily scolding him for trying to trick him. Any other person, he said, would not be so kind to return shikigami that were employed against him! Chitoku realized that he was in way over his head; not only could Seimei see through his disguise, but he was able to manipulate all of his spells as well. He bowed low, begged for forgiveness, and offered to become Seimei’s servant.\n\nAbe no Seimei’s chief rival was a sorcerer from Harima named Ashiya Dōman. Dōman was much older than Seimei, and believed that there was no one in the land who was a better onmyōji than he was. Upon hearing of Seimei’s genius, he challenged him to a magical duel.\n\nOn the day of the competition, many officials and witnesses came to watch. The two sorcerers met in the imperial gardens for the contest. First, Dōman picked up a handful of sand, concentrated over it for a moment, and threw it into the air. The particles of sand turned into countless swallows which began to flit around the garden. Seimei waved his folding fan one time, and all of the swallows turned back into grits of sand.\n\nNext, Seimei recited a spell. A dragon appeared in the sky above. Rain began to fall all around them. Dōman recited his spell, however as hard as he tried, he could not cause the dragon to vanish. Instead, the rain grew fiercer and fiercer, filling the garden with water up to Dōman’s waist. Finally, Seimei cast his spell again. The rain stopped, and the dragon vanished.\n\nThe third and final contest was a divination challenge: the contestants had to guess the contents of a wooden box. Dōman, indignant at having lost the previous round, challenged Seimei: “Whoever loses this round will become the other’s servant!” Dōman confidently declared that there were 15 oranges inside of the box. Seimei contradicted him, saying that there were 15 rats in the box. The emperor and his attendants who had prepared the test shook their heads, for they had put 15 oranges in the box. They announced that Seimei had lost. However, when they opened the box, 15 rats leaped out! Not only had Seimei divined the contents of the box, he had transformed the oranges into rats, tricking Dōman and the entire court. Victory went to Seimei.\n\nAshiya Dōman continued to hold a grudge against Abe no Seimei, and continued to plot against him. He seduced Seimei’s wife and convinced her to tell him Seimei’s magical secrets. She showed him the stone box in which Seimei kept Hoki Naiden, his book of spells. Hoki Naiden was a book of secrets which had been passed down since time immemorial from India to Tang, China. It came into the possession of the Japanese envoy, Kibi no Makibi. When Kibi no Makibi returned to Japan from Tang, he presented the secret book to the relatives of his friend Abe no Nakamaro, who remained in China. From there it was passed down and eventually inherited by Abe no Seimei.\n\nOne night when Seimei returned home, Dōman boasted that he had acquired Seimei’s secret magic book. Seimei scolded him, saying that was impossible. So impossible, in fact, that if Dōman did have the book, he could cut Seimei’s throat. Dōman triumphantly presented the book, and Seimei, realizing that he had been betrayed by his wife, offered his throat to Dōman. Dōman gladly cut it open. Seimei died.\n\nWhen Seimei was murdered, Saint Hokudō—the Chinese wizard who had given Hoki Naiden to Kibi no Makibi—sensed the loss of a great sorcerer. He traveled across the sea to Japan, collected Seimei’s bones, and restored Abe no Seimei to life. The pair of them set out to get revenge on Dōman and Seimei’s ex-wife, who was now married to Dōman.\n\nSaint Hokudō paid a visit to Seimei’s home, where Dōman and his wife were now living. He asked if Abe no Seimei was home, to which Dōman replied that, unfortunately, Abe no Seimei had been murdered some time ago. Saint Hokudō said that was impossible, for he had just seen Seimei earlier that day. Dōman laughed at him, saying that was impossible. So impossible, in fact, that if Seimei was actually alive, he could cut Dōman’s throat. Saint Hokudō called out to Abe no Seimei, who presented himself. He then promptly cut open the throats of Ashiya Dōman and his wife.\n\nToday, Abe no Seimei is worshipped as a god at many shrines throughout Japan. His main shrine is located in Kyōto, and sits on the site of his former house.\n\n",

They are always full, and never need to be refilled. They are a bit mischievous like all tsukumogami, although while they may wander around the house a little bit, they don’t do anything harmful to humans.\n\nInteractions: Despite their strange appearance, kameosa are spirits of good fortune and bounty. They are extremely lucky yōkai to have around the house. They can serve up an endless supply of water or sake—whatever they hold. No matter how much is scooped out for cooking, cleaning, or drinking, they always remain full.\n\nOrigin: Kameosa was invented by Toriyama Sekien for his fourth and final yōkai encyclopedia, Hyakki tsurezure bukuro—a book full of tsukumogami based on puns. Kameosa may be a pun based on Koikawa Harumachi, a student of Sekien’s whose nickname was also Kameosa (written with different characters), and who loved drinking sake. As kameosa is the final yōkai in the book, it is also the final yōkai in Sekien’s yōkai series. He may have designed this yōkai of good luck and bounteous fortune as a way to end his book and his series on a positive, celebratory note—or even as a way to pass the reigns to his disciple Harumachi.\n\n",

They are in houses as pets, on farms as exterminators, or in cities and towns as strays. Like many of Japan’s animals, when cats live to an old age they develop supernatural powers and transform into yōkai. Bakeneko begin their supernatural life looking almost identical to an ordinary housecat. Soon they begin to walk about at on their hind legs. As they age and their powers increase, they can grow large indeed—up to the size of a full-grown human.\n\nBehavior: Bakeneko possess great shape-shifting abilities and disguise themselves as smaller cats or humans—sometimes even taking the shape of their own masters. Many learn to speak human languages. While in disguise, they are known to dress up as humans with towels wrapped around their heads. In this form bakeneko dance around merrily. While this sounds frivolous and even cute, bakeneko are a menace to any house they live in or near. They can eat things that are much bigger than they are, and can even consume poisonous things without difficulty. It is possible for a bakeneko to eat its own master and then assume his form, living in his place. If they do not directly kill their owners, they can bring down great curses and misfortune. They can summon ghostly fireballs and are known to accidentally start house fires, their tails acting like torches igniting any flammable materials in the house. Bakeneko also have the disturbing ability to reanimate fresh corpses and use them like puppets for their own nefarious purposes.\n\nOrigin: Bakeneko can come into being as a result of a number of things, but the most common reasons are by being long-lived (over 13 years old), growing to a certain size (over 3.75 kilograms), or by licking up large quantities of lamp oil. A telltale sign that a cat may be close to becoming a bakeneko is believed to be an exceptionally long tail. The older and wiser a cat gets, the longer its tail becomes. This superstition led to the custom of bobbing cats’ tails at an early age to prevent them from transforming into yōkai.\n\n",

They make creepy noises, creaking and thumping, and track dirty footprints throughout the house. Usutsuki warashi do not cause any actual harm, though they spread unease and discomfort in houses that they infect. Unlike other zashiki warashi, these troublemakers do not bring any good fortune to their homes. However, a house which drives these spirits away will still fall into ruin, just like a house that drives away the more pleasant zashiki warashi.\n\nOrigin: This spirit’s origin is similar to that of the yama uba. It comes from the old and terrible practice of kuchiberashi, or “reducing the mouths to feed” by thinning out families during times when food was scarce. Some houses with too many mouths to feed had no other choice but to sacrifice the newly born. The cost of a funeral also being too high, these children were buried underneath the house or in a storage shed.

Unless their disguise is discovered, they tend to be models of domesticity—cooking, cleaning, and taking care of their homes while their husbands are away working. However, it is difficult for a sea creature to live on the land, so inevitably their disguise is discovered. When this happens, a tako nyōbō has no choice but to return to the sea and never see her husband again.\n\nOrigin: Tako nyōbō come from the folklore of Ishikawa Prefecture, but stories of animals taking human form and marrying humans are found in every corner of Japan. It is a common theme in Japanese folklore. While these tales can begin in any number of different ways, they almost always end in tragedy. There’s an unwritten rule among yōkai stories that if a supernatural spouse’s true identity is discovered, they must leave their partner forever.\n\nLegends: A man from Kanazawa was astonished by how good the broth that his wife made for him every day tasted. The broth was so delicious, in fact, that he began to grow suspicious of her. One day, he pretended to head off to work but instead climbed up into the rafters to spy upon his wife. He watched as his wife took out a large washbasin and filled it with boiling water. Then, she transformed into an octopus and entered the tub. She splashed about inside the boiling tub. His wife was using her own body as soup stock!\n\nThe man climbed down from the rafters and confronted his wife. “This whole time you’ve been washing your body like this and feeding me your bathwater?!”\n\nThe wife replied, “That’s right.

It resembles a black dog with no tail and a human-like face.\n\nBehavior: Being a tree spirit, the hōkō is said to be similar to a kodama or a yamabiko, although Toriyama Sekien goes out of his way to specifically mention that despite the similar appearance it is a separate yōkai from the yamabiko.\n\nInteractions: Most hōkō encounters are accidental. They usually involve an old woodcutter chopping into a camphor tree with an axe, and blood comes out from the tree—because a hōkō was living inside. Nevertheless there are a number of records of hōkō appearing in Japanese and Chinese chronicles. Hōkō are recorded as being edible; the ancient Chinese records that mention them include accounts of them being stewed and eaten. Apparently they taste sweet and sour, and similar to dog meat.\n\nOrigin: Hōkō is the Japanese pronunciation of this spirit’s Chinese name: penghou. Because of gradual changes in the writing systems of China and Japan, the characters used to write hōkō do not translate perfectly in Japanese. Legends generally refer to the hōkō being found inside of camphor trees. However, the first characters in its name can refer to a different kind of evergreen in Japanese: the sakaki (Cleyera japonica), which is an important sacred tree in Shinto. The second character in its name was used as a title for feudal lords. It’s not really clear that these were the intended meanings in the original Chinese though. According to legend, its name was recorded in the yōkai encyclopedia Hakutaku zu—the last surviving copy of which was lost thousands of years ago—so its true meaning is difficult to decipher.\n\n",

However, this relationship can only last while the fisherman remains unaware of the hamaguri nyōbō’s true identity. If it is ever discovered, the clam must leave her husband and return to the sea forever.\n\nOrigin: Legends of animal brides marrying human men are a common theme in Japanese folklore, found in all regions of Japan. A central theme to these stories is a taboo against looking—usually at the mysterious wife’s true form, but not always. When that taboo is inevitably broken, the couple must separate permanently. Hamaguri nyōbō are a well-known example of this trope, but countless variations on this theme featuring other animals (such as cranes, foxes, frogs, and octopuses) or even monsters (such as yuki onna) can be found.\n\nLegends: Long ago in a village by the sea lived a fisherman named Mokichi. One day Mokichi caught a clam of tremendous size. “A clam this large would sell for a small fortune,” thought Mokichi. But on closer inspection, he noticed a crack in the clam’s shell. It must have had a difficult life, and it surely had taken a long time for it to grow so large. Mokichi pitied the clam and decided to throw it back.\n\nWhen Mokichi returned home, a beautiful young woman was waiting for him. “My name is Ohama. I’ve fallen in love with you. Please won’t you take me as your wife?”\n\nMokichi accepted Ohama as his wife and welcomed her into his home. Not only was she beautiful, her cooking was astonishingly good. In particular, her miso soup was beyond anything Mokichi had ever tasted. Mokichi asked Ohama how she was able to make such tasty soup, but she refused to tell him. What’s more, Ohama warned Mokichi that he must never see her cook, and she made him promise not to.\n\nMokichi kept his promise for a time, but the secret of Ohama’s cooking nagged at him. How could her miso soup be so delicious? Eventually his curiosity got the better of him. Mokichi peeked into the kitchen. What he saw shocked him: Ohama was straddling over the cooking pot and urinating into it!\n\nThat night, when Ohama served Mokichi his dinner, he was oddly silent. She encouraged him to drink his miso soup, but he refused. Then Ohama guessed what had happened.\n\n“You saw me, didn’t you?” she asked.\n\nMokichi nodded.\n\nOhama turned around and walked out the door. She went to the seaside, knelt at the water’s edge, and cried. Slowly she changed back into her true form: she was the giant clam whose life Mokichi had spared. The clam slipped into the water and swam away, and was never seen again.\n\n",

Thus, little is known about their regular activities. They can be curious, and occasionally approach boats, clinging on to their sides or stealing objects off of them and taking them back to their underwater lairs. Kawaguma can be more than a nuisance, though, as they sometimes dig at riverbanks, breaking them and causing floods.\n\nOrigin: Kawaguma come from the folklore of northern areas, especially the Omono River Akita Prefecture and the Shinano River in Niigata Prefecture. Kawaguma appear in Tsuki no Dewa michi, one volume of a large Edo period travelogue by Sugae Masumi detailing stories and observations from the author’s experiences in Dewa Province.\n\nLegends: Long ago a lord went hunting in his boat down the Omono River. Suddenly a hand covered in black fur stretched up from the bottom of the river and snatched his rifle away. Afterwards, an skilled swimmer went diving and discovered the lord’s stolen rifle at the bottom of the deepest part of the river. From then on, the rifle was known as “the kawaguma gun” and kept as a treasured possession by the Satake clan.\n\nAlso on the Omono River, late one night a ferryman at Tsubakigawa had just finished tying up his boat on the riverbank  when suddenly he heard a splash in the water behind him. He saw a pair of hands clinging to the side of the boat. The ferryman was surprised, and chopped at the hands with a large knife. When morning came, he discovered a severed hand inside the boat.

Generally, she supposedly lives near a place called “the snake mound.” She scares those who stay too close to her home by attacking them with her snakes.\n\nOrigin: It’s not quite clear where this yōkai originally comes from. She was recorded in 1780 by Toriyama Sekien in his book Konjaku hyakki shūi. Because she carries two snakes, Sekien speculated that Jakotsu babā originally came from the mythical country of Bukan (also called Fukan; known as Wuxian in Chinese). Bukan is recorded in the Shan hai jing, which Toriyama Sekien uses as his source for this record. It was supposedly located far to the west, past China on the Asian continent. The race of people who lived in Bukan were shamans, and they used snakes prominently in their divinations.\n\nAccording to Sekien, long ago there was an important man in Bukan named Jagoemon who lived in a place known as “the snake mound.” His wife was known as Jagobā (i.e. “Jago’s wife”). Over time, her name was corrupted into jakotsu babā. Jagoemon is not a famous historical or mythical figure, so Sekien’s reference may have just been invented for fun. Prior to Konjaku hyakki shūi, the name jakotsu babā appears in various pulp fiction and kabuki plays of the 1760’s and 1770’s—although it was just used as a vulgar slang word for an old woman, rather than a yōkai or a shaman. Some scholars believe that Sekien may just have taken a popular buzzword of his time, transformed it into a yōkai and attached a simple backstory to it.\n\n",

The rank of ashirei includes ordinary, non-magical foxes as well as magical kitsune. Because of this, the vast majority of kitsune belong to this rank.\n\nAround age fifty, all kitsune begin their ascetic training to develop their wizardry. They begin to study ancient occult practices worshiping the sun, moon, and stars. Most notably, they develop shape shifting abilities. This is accomplished by facing the Big Dipper and placing a human skull on their head. Other objects may be incorporated into this spell to flesh out the disguise. For example, a kitsune who wishes to disguise itself as a cook might also place cookware on its body. To transform into one of their favorite disguises—a beautiful young woman—a kitsune will place duckweed, a lily pad, or other leaves on its head, transforming them into long, elegant hair.\n\nBy the time an ashirei has reached one hundred years old, it has honed its magical skills enough to be promoted to the next rank: chiko.\n\nInteractions: Because ashirei is the largest rank, most of the kitsune which humans encounter belong to rank. Before they attain their magical powers, ashirei are easily ensnared in traps, injured, or even killed by hunters or dogs. Only after attaining magical powers do they begin to pose a threat to humans. Once an ashirei begins to use magic, it becomes more dangerous—often seeking revenge against humans who wronged it or its friends.\n\nOrigin: Kitsune lore is rooted in ancient superstitions which developed over many centuries in China before arriving in Japan. The term ashirei comes from Azi, an evil fox spirit from a 3rd century Chinese legend. A soldier named Wang Lingxaio was repeatedly lured away from his post by a beautiful woman named Azi. One day, he deserted his post completely. Wang’s commanding officer, Chen Hao, suspected that the woman had been some sort of demon. Chen gathered his men and dogs and tracked Wang to a cave. They found him lying on the floor inside, half transformed into a fox. He was calling out helplessly for Azi. After being rescued, Wang confessed that the pleasure of being with her was incomparable to anything he had ever experienced.\n\nAzi’s name, which is pronounced Ashi in Japanese, became synonymous for a beautiful and honeymouthed temptress with a wicked heart and a cruel lust for torturing men. Her legend became a pattern for future kitsune stories.\n\n",

The location of Taizan and the identity of whatever animal inspired this yōkai are lost to history.\n\nThe name rokugyo comes from roku, the Japanese pronunciation of its Chinese name, plus gyo (fish). The Chinese character invented for creature means “land-dwelling fish.” Today, this kanji is read as mutsu, and refers to the gnomefish (Scombrops boops).

Their appearance resembles the classic image of a yūrei—a kimono-clad, long-haired, semi-translucent human whose image fades away towards the feet.\n\nBehavior: Fuda are protection charms popular throughout Japan. They are usually made of a strip of paper containing holy images or calligraphy, such as the name of a god, a sutra, or a buddha. They are used to ward an area from evil forces. Yōkai are not able to enter buildings or cross boundaries protected by these talismans. A fudakaeshi’s goal is to remove these protections so that it and other yōkai can pass freely.\n\nInteractions: Being spirits themselves, fudagaeshi cannot touch fuda to remove them. Therefore, they must convince humans to remove the fuda instead. They do this by threatening, bribing, or promising something to tempt the hearts of the greedy and foolish. Unsurprisingly, those who are willing to help an evil spirit in this way do not actually receive their reward, but instead soon meet with calamity.\n\nOrigin: Fudakaeshi were first described as a yōkai in the Kyōka hyakumonogatari, a collection of comical yōkai-themed poems from the late Edo Period. However, the concept of spirits attempting to remove protection charms goes back much further than that.\n\nLegends: An example of a fudakaeshi appears in the famous ghost story Botan dōrō (“The Tale of the Peony Lantern”). A ghost which has fallen in love with a living man is unable to enter his house because of the protective charms placed on it. She begs the man to remove the fuda so that she can enter and spend the night with him. Eventually, her pleading moves his heart, and he removes the talismans. The ghost is then able to enter his home and sleep with the man, but in doing so she drains his life away and he dies.\n\n",

They are spiritual beings without true physical bodies, and can take many different forms. Occasionally they appear in human form (usually beautiful women).\n\nBehavior: When a kitsune gains the rank of kiko, it sheds its body and begins to live a spiritual existence. Their duty is to act as servants and messengers of Inari Ōkami, one of Shinto’s major gods. The vast majority of kitsune in Inari’s service are kiko.

It is a soft, flabby, corpse-like spirit with oily black skin and a pungent smell. Trailing behind is a catfish-like tail connected to its spine. The most striking and disturbing feature is this spirit’s eyeballs, which dangle wildly from its eye sockets.\n\nInteractions: Nuribotoke do not do much other than fly about, flap their tails, and terrorize the families whose butsudan they crawled out from. They dance about impishly and revel in their ability to terrorize the living. Occasionally they try to trick foolish humans by giving false prophecies. They can be kept at bay by sprinkling salt on the floor, which they will avoid crossing. Nuribotoke must return to the butsudan before sunrise, and they vanish altogether during the day. Even though they are mostly harmless, it is best to prevent their appearance altogether by shutting the butsudan at night.\n\nOrigin: In most Japanese homes there is a large, ornate, wooden shrine called a butsudan. Inside are religious icons, scrolls, mantras, statues, and other holy items. It serves as the center of household spirituality, and the ancestors of a family are all enshrined in it. During the day, the butsudan stays open. During holidays and special occasions, it is treated like a member of the family and treated to offerings of food and sake. The doors to a butsudan are always closed at sunset—the butsudan is a gateway to the spirit world. Superstition warns that if the butsudan is left open certain spirits can wander freely back and forth between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Nuribotoke is one of these spirits.\n\n",

            "content": "荼枳尼\nだきにTranslation: none; a transliteration of the Sanskrit term dakini\nAlternate names: Dakiniten, Daten, Shinko’ō, Kiko Tennō\nHabitat: the sky\nDiet: human hearts, blood, and fleshAppearance: Dakini—or Dakiniten, as she is commonly called in Japan—is an esoteric goddess and an important figure in Shingon Buddhism. She is usually depicted as a beautiful half-nude woman carrying a wish-granting jewel and riding a white fox. She is revered across Japan as a goddess of food and grain, foxes, and good fortune who is willing to grant any wish. She serves Benzaiten, the goddess of wisdom, and Daikokuten, the god of grain. In Shintō-Buddhist syncretism she is associated with the kami Inari. She is the Japanese version of the dakini from Indian cosmology.\n\nInteractions: Dakini was an important goddess to the nobility and samurai classes during the Middle Ages. Both the shōgun and the emperor venerated and prayed to Dakini, believing that failure to do so would bring an end to their rule. Secret rituals relating to Dakini worship were passed down orally through the imperial household. These became an integral part of the emperor’s enthronement ceremony.\n\nDakini worship involved secret techniques to invoke her black magic. Knowledge of the deepest secrets of her esoteric worship was believed to grant unlimited power. The ability to trap a kitsune and force it to perform kitsunetsuki was among the powers that Dakini bestowed upon her worshipers.\n\nOrigin: In Buddhist cosmology, the dakini were originally a race of wrathful sky-dwelling demons who served Kali and feasted upon the flesh of humans. They were energetic, wise, and muse-like spirits. They looked like beautiful nude women, carried fearsome swords for cutting out hearts, and drank blood from cups made of skulls. The dakini listened to the Buddha’s teachings and converted to Buddhism. Although they required human meat in order to survive, as part of their submission to Buddism, they promised to feast only upon the meat of the recently dead. In order to ensure that they would not starve, the dakini were granted the power to see six months into the future. This way they could wait near the people who were going to die soon and feast upon their flesh before other carrion-eating demons arrived.\n\nIn China, the dakini came to be associated with jackals (possibly due to the fact that both dakini and jackals fed on carrion). Jackals did not exist in China, but the creature was described as a clever, wicked, magical beast who feeds on humans and looks like a dog. That description perfectly fit with Chinese folklore about foxes, who disguise themselves as beautiful women and feed on human life force. Jackals did not exist in Japan either, and so the word for jackals—yakan—was considered to be synonymous with foxes in Japan. Thus, the Japanese interpretation of dakini became associated with foxes.\n\nBy the time Buddhism had been transmitted from India, through China, to Japan, the dakini had been fused with various Buddhist, Shintō, onmyōdō, and folkloric concepts. In Japan, they changed from a race of demonic spirits into a single goddess resembling both a yasha and tennyo.\n\nAs a result of her long and complicated history, and the esoteric nature of her religious practice, Dakini is known by many different names, such as Shinko’ō (“Dragon Fox Queen”), Kiko Tennō (“Noble Fox Empress”), and many more due to her syncretism with Inari.\n\nLegends: Genpei seisuiki, an extended narrative of the Tale of the Heike describes an encounter with a servant of Dakini. Long ago, and impoverished young samurai named Taira no Kiyomori went hunting and shot a fox. He thought he had killed it, but to his surprise the fox suddenly transformed into a beautiful woman. She explained that she was a servant of Dakini. She promised that if Kiyomori spared her life, she would see to it that all of his wishes would come true. Kiyomori let her go free, and began to pray to Dakini. True to the fox’s word, not long after that Kiyomori’s luck began to change. His family rose to prominence, and he became wealthy and powerful. He continued to worship Dakini, and for a time the Taira were the most powerful samurai clan in Japan. His success is often credited to Dakini’s influence.\n\n",

The tree got its name from the peculiar bulbs on it which were not only shaped like breasts, but also produced nourishing milk. The legend of the tree was turned into a famous rakugyo performance in the Meiji Period. Similar tales of miraculous trees with breastmilk-producing bulbs can be found even today.\n\nLegends: Long ago a samurai-turned-painter named Hishikawa Shigenobu lived in Edo with his wife Okise and their baby boy Mayotarō. His apprentice was a skillful young man named Isogai Namie. Unbeknownst to Shigenobu, Namie lusted after Okise.\n\nOne day, Shigenobu was called away to paint a temple ceiling. He took his servant Shōsuke with him. In their absence, Namie approached Okise and threatened to murder the boy Mayotarō if she did not sleep with him. With nobody to protect her, she agreed. Gradually, she came to return Namie’s affection. Their affair continued for some time, but Namie knew it would end when Shigenobu came home. So he devised a plan to ensure that his master would never return.\n\nNamie visited Shigenobu under the pretense of seeing his progress. Shigenobu was nearly finished, with only the arm of the female dragon left to paint. That evening, Namie coerced Shōsuke into helping him assassinate Shigenobu. Shōsuke returned to the temple and invited Shigenobu out to watch the fireflies with him. While enjoying the nighttime spectacle, Shōsuke got Shigenobu very drunk. Then, on the way back to the temple, Namie attacked and slew the drunk old samurai.\n\nShōsuke rushed to the temple to report that brigands had attacked his master. However, when he arrived, he saw that Shigenobu was there! The painter had just finished the female dragon’s arm, and was signing his name to the painting. When Shigenobu turned to look at him, Shōsuke was so shocked that he fainted. When he came to, Shigenobu was gone… Had it been a ghost?\n\nNot long after that, Namie and the widow Okise were married. Shōsuke remained in Namie’s service. Namie and Okise had a baby. However, Namie did not like raising Shigenobu’s son in addition to his own. He ordered Shōsuke to murder Mayotarō.\n\nShōsuke took the boy to a waterfall and flung him off into the abyss. Peering down into the waterfall’s basin, he was shocked to the core. The ghost of his murdered master Shigenobu was there! It had caught the baby boy, and was cradling him safely. Shigenobu’s ghost approached Shōsuke and commanded him to take Mayotarō to the nearby temple of Shōgetsuin. Shōsuke was so shocked that he reformed his ways and did as he was commanded. Mayotarō was brought to Shōgetsuin, where Shōsuke raised him. There was a miraculous hackberry tree with bulbs on it shaped like breasts on the temple grounds. The tree produced a milk that was sweet and nourishing, and allowed Mayotarō to grow up strong and healthy.\n\nOkise became haunted by visions of Shigenobu’s ghost. She developed painful tumors in her breasts, and was unable to produce milk for her and Namie’s newborn. The baby became sickly and died. Not long after that, Okise herself went mad and died in agony.\n\nFive years later, the story of the boy raised on the hackberry’s milk spread far and wide. When it reached Namie’s ears, he realized what had happened to Shōsuke and Mayotarō. Namie went to Shōgetsuin with the intent of murdering them both. Upon reaching the temple, he surprised Shōsuke and Mayotarō, who were unable to defend themselves. At that very moment, Shigenobu’s ghost appeared and directed Mayotarō’s swordhand. Namie was struck dead. Shigenobu’s ghost, having achieved his vengeance, vanished forever.\n\n",

A tenko can become a kūko after reaching three thousand years of age. Upon achieving this rank, a kitsune takes on a much more human-like appearance. They lose their tails entirely, although their ears still resemble a fox’s. They do not have physical bodies, and exist as being of pure spirit. They are telepathic and clairvoyant, and can even see into the future. Their level of magical power is the highest it will ever be: on par with the gods.\n\nBehavior: Although they are the oldest and most powerful form of kitsune, kūko are only the second-highest ranking kitsune, after tenko. This is because after three thousand years they have reached a sort of retirement age where they are no longer working in the service of Inari—whereas younger kitsune still actively serve the gods. A kūko’s duties are more like that of a privy council member or a venerated elder.\n\nInteractions: When kūko interact with human beings, it is only to do good deeds. They might increase the prosperity of a temple or a household. They might help a good and honest person achieve fame for their skills. And they might possess a pure-hearted but foolish person in order to teach him how to improve his life. When a kūko possesses a human, it does not cause mental disorder or sickness in the way that is commonly associated with kitsune tsuki.\n\nLegends: A late Edo Period book called Kyūsensha manpitsu tells the story of an encounter with a kūko.\n\nA kūko who had been living in Kyōto for a long time decided to make a journey to Edo. Along the way, he stopped to rest at the house of a samurai named Nagasaki Genjirō. He decided to “borrow” the body of one of Genjirō’s servants—a fourteen year old boy. He spoke through the boy and described to Genjirō the different ranks of kitsune and the differences between zenko and yako—good and bad kitsune. He explained that while yako harm humans, zenko possess stubborn or foolish humans in order to teach them important lessons, and they only use their magic to help people. He explained that he was in fact a zenko, merely inhabiting the boy’s body temporarily.\n\nThe kūko remained in control of Genjirō’s servant’s body for five days. During this time, he entertained Genjirō’s household and neighbors with tales of the Genpei War, the Battle of Dannoura, and the Battle of Sekigahara. After everyone had been thoroughly entertained, the kūko departed the servant’s body—but not before he used his magic to cure the diseases and ailments the boy had been suffering from.\n\nBefore he left, as a gesture of thanks for Genjirō’s hospitality, the kūko left presented Genjirō with a signed calligraphic scroll containing the secret inner teachings of Hakke Shinto.\n\n",

She transformed herself into a human girl and sold herself off as a geisha in order to repay the kindness her former owner showed her.\n\nOrigin: Okesa gave her name to a genre of Japanese folk music popular among the sailors and villagers of Sado Island: okesa bushi. According to folklore, this style of music was unheard of in Edo until Okesa began to perform it. It became so popular that the style was named after her.\n\nLegends: Long ago, there was an old woman who lived alone by the shore on Sado Island. She loved cats, and since she was young she had always kept a dozen or so cats. As she grew older, her savings grew smaller and smaller, until there came a day when she struggled to even buy food. As a result, her cats one by one left the house. Eventually all that remained was an old, beloved calico cat.\n\nThe old woman loved this cat so much that even when she could not find enough food to feed herself, she made sure the cat never went hungry. However, eventually a day came where she could no longer feed either herself or the cat. She said to the cat, “Look how poor I’ve become. I can’t even feed you anymore. Even so, please don’t leave me. You’re the dearest thing to me in the whole world.”\n\nBut the next day, the cat was gone.\n\nThe old woman despaired. Every human had abandoned her to her poverty, and now even her last cat had left her. The old woman cried alone in her empty house.\n\nAll of a sudden, the door opened and a beautiful girl entered. She introduced herself to the old woman: “I am the calico cat whom you cared for and loved for so many years. Please let me repay your kindness.” The girl looked entirely human, with no trace of cat about her. The old woman could hardly believe her eyes.\n\n“What do you plan on doing looking like that?” the old woman asked. “And besides, you don’t owe me anything.”\n\n“You gave up everything for me. I cannot let you suffer like this. I heard that a man from Edo is in town scouting for girls to become geisha. Please introduce me to him.” The girl displayed such earnestness that the old woman could not refuse. She arranged a meeting with the man from Edo.\n\nWhen the man from Edo came to the house, he was enchanted. “Such a beautiful girl could surely become a leading geisha in Edo!” he proclaimed. He offered the old woman a large sum of money—enough to live comfortable for the rest of her life—and he took the girl with him back to Edo.\n\nSeveral months later, a bewitching new geisha debuted Fukagawa. She took the name Okesa, and rumors spread across Edo of her charm and beauty. She was said to be like a painting of a famous artist come to life. She sang songs that nobody had ever heard before. People flocked from all around to see and hear this mysterious geisha. Her restaurant was packed every night with customers there to see the legendary Okesa with their own eyes.\n\nOne night, a sea captain and his crew visited the restaurant and asked for Okesa to perform for them. They were willing to pay any amount, and so they threw a wild, lavish party. Okesa sang, and danced, and played the shamisen for the sailors, who sang and danced along. They ate and drank all afternoon and evening. The party did not end until every last one of them was splayed out across the floor, dead drunk. Only the captain managed to crawl into the bedroom before passing out.\n\nThe captain woke up in the middle of the night. There was a strange crunching noise coming from the next room. He opened the sliding doors  a crack and peered inside. A gigantic cat was chewing on the heads of the fish left over from the party. The cat was dressed as geisha, and its kimono was the same as Okesa’s.\n\nThe cat glared at the captain and said, “Tell nobody what you have seen. If you do, I will get you for it!” Terrified, the captain nodded his head, closed the door, and hid under his covers.\n\nThe next morning, the sailors left the restaurant and returned to their boat. It was a beautiful day. The sky was clear and the water smooth—perfect weather for sailing. As they headed out to sea, the sailors reminisced about the incredible party they had the previous night. They all agreed that they had never seen such a beauty as Okesa, or heard such unusual songs as the ones she sang.\n\nThen the captain, still shaken from what he saw, spoke up. “That geisha… None of you saw her true form…”\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the crew.\n\n“Her true form. That geisha was a bakeneko!” And the captain revealed to his crew the terrible fright he had the previous night.\n\nThe sailors burst out in laughter. But suddenly, the clear sky grew dark and storm clouds quickly rolled in, and the sailors stopped laughing. “Storm! Storm!” they cried, and ran to their posts. A black cloud rolled over the boat, and a gigantic cat appeared in the cloud. The cat grabbed the captain and pulled him, screaming, up into the sky.\n\nThe boat shook and tossed about in the rough seas like a leaf on the wind. The crew held on for dear life and screamed, “Please spare us! We swear to never tell anyone what we just saw!”\n\nAnd then just as quickly as it arrived, the storm cleared. The seas were peaceful once again. The crew was saved. The captain, however, was never seen again.\n\n",

Often, large and dangerous yōkai take up residence in these domiciles. One of these is the ao nyōbō, an ogreish spirit of poverty and misfortune. She takes the appearance of an ancient court noblewoman. Her body is draped in the elaborate, many layered kimonos of ancient eras. Once fabulous, her gowns are now tattered and moth-ridden. She wears the white face of ancient courtiers, with high painted eyebrows and blackened teeth. Aged and wrinkled from years of waiting in musty old ruins, her beauty has long left her.\n\nBehavior: Ao nyōbō inhabit the empty, abandoned homes of ruined families and fallen nobles. They wait in the house, constantly applying their makeup, fixing their hair, and adjusting their image. They act as if they are in anticipation for the arrival of some guest—perhaps a lover who has lost interest, or a husband who has abandoned his wife. In any case, should a trespasser visit a home inhabited by an ao nyōbō, she devours them whole. And then goes back to waiting vainly for someone who will never show.\n\nOrigin: Nyōbō were the court ladies of old Japan. The paragons of youth, beauty, education, and refinement, nyōbō served in the palaces of high ranking families, a position they held until they themselves were married to a worthy suitor. After marriage, they idled their days in their own private residences, patiently waiting for their husbands to come home each night, or for secret lovers to show up during the day. But not all nyōbō were so successful.\n\nThe ao in the name ao nyōbō means the color blue. This does not refer to skin color, but implies immaturity or inexperience (just as green implies the same in English). There were some low-ranking women of the old imperial court who—no matter how hard they worked—couldn’t seem to attract a husband or elevate themselves. These “blue” nyōbō were destined to grow into bitter old maids, desperate to increase their social status but never able to escape from their subordinate positions. When they died, these unsuccessful courtiers turned into yōkai.\n\n",

A famous tale describes how umishika are responsible for a taboo against fishing during the 16th day of the 5th month of the old lunar calendar.\n\nLegends: Long ago, the 16th day of the 5th month was a holy day for the mountain gods. All of the gods and spirits of the mountains gathered together to have a large banquet on that day, and so villagers were forbidden from entering the mountains.\n\nOne year on that day, a fishing boat from the village of Issō went out to catch skipjack tuna in the open sea northwest of the island. A great many fish were swarming near the surface of the sea, and the fishermen were certain there was a large shoal nearby. When the boat arrived at the spot, the fishermen were delighted by how easily they effortlessly caught one fish after another.\n\nAll of a sudden, a large, dark shape appeared beneath the water’s surface. An elder fishermen called out, “It’s an umishika!” The fishermen hurriedly pulled in their lines, raised the sails, and prepared to return to shore. But the umishika had spotted them.\n\nThe umishika chased the ship, dipping in and out between the waves. The wind blew against the boat and made escape difficult. The fishermen rowed with all of their might. They tried to slow its advance by dumping all of the tuna they had caught into their wake. But before long the umishika was upon them.\n\nAs the umishika was about to climb onto the ship, one of the fishermen grabbed an oar and thrust it with all of his might into the monster’s open mouth. The umishika fell back into the sea and stopped pursuing the boat. The fishermen rowed nonstop back to shore, exhausted from their effort but grateful for their lives.\n\nThe villagers decided that on that day it would be forbidden to enter not only the mountains, but the sea as well. From then on, both hunters and fishermen stayed home on the 16th day of the 5th month to make offerings and hold festivals for the gods of the mountains and seas.\n\n",

Stories about animal husbands or wives marrying human partners are found in every region in Japan. Many variations of each tale exist, but they usually have similar plots based on which animal is involved. Tsuru nyōbō stories often follow a pattern resembling the following story from Niigata Prefecture.\n\nLegends: One winter, a poor young man was gathering firewood in the mountains. He came across an crane flapping pitiably on the ground. Its wing had been pierced by a hunter’s arrow. The man approached the crane and gently removed the arrow. Then he applied some medicine and bandaged the wing. Afterwards, the crane flew up into the air and cried happily.

When he returned, the woman was still there. Not only that, she had cleaned the whole house. She stayed the following day too, and the day after that. She made no mention of continuing on her journey, and the man did not ask her about it, for he enjoyed her company. This carried on for some time.\n\nOne day the woman told the man that she would like to be his wife. The man could not believe that such a beautiful young woman would want to marry someone as poor as him. She assured him that she had thought carefully about her decision. He liked having her around, so he happily took her as his bride. For a wedding gift, she asked him to build her a loom. When it was completed, she announced that she would weave a brocade. She insisted that she needed total privacy to work. She asked her husband to leave her alone in her workroom for seven days, and she made him promise that he would not look in on her.\n\nThe husband listened to the clack-clack-boom of the loom as his wife worked. But he kept his promise and did not spy upon her. After the seventh day she emerged from her workroom looking exhausted. She carried the most splendid piece of fabric the man had ever seen before. She instructed him to take the brocade into town and sell it to the lord for one thousand ryō. He was astonished—could it really be worth such a lordly sum?\n\nThe man did as she asked, and the lord bought the fabric for one thousand ryō. Then, the lord commanded him to make another brocade just like the first one. He returned home with the fortune he had received for the fabric and told his wife that the lord wanted another one just like it. She seemed reluctant to weave another one. However, as the lord had commanded it, her husband’s life would be in danger if he did not deliver it. She agreed to weave one more. And once again, she made her husband promise not to look upon her while she was working.\n\nThe husband listened to the clack-clack-boom of the loom as his wife worked. But this time, he wondered how she could weave such an extraordinary brocade when they didn’t even own a single spool of thread. His curiosity overpowered him. He opened the door to the workroom and peaked inside. There, working the loom, was a crane where his wife should have been. The crane pulled out its own feathers one by one, using them in place of thread to weave the fabric. Its body was nearly plucked bare, and covered in painful red spots. Astonished, the man quietly closed the door and let the crane finish its work.\n\nAfter the seventh day the woman emerged from the workroom looking gaunt. She carried a brocade equal in splendor to the first one. It would surely sell for one thousand ryō. She gave the fabric to her husband, and looked at him with sad eyes. She explained that she was the crane he had saved from the hunter that night. In order to repay his kindness, she had changed into a human in order to be by his side. But he had broken his promise and spied upon her, and now she could no longer be with him. Though it was brief, she would cherish their time together forever.\n\nThen she transformed into a crane and flew up into the sky. She called out one last time, and a flock of cranes passed overhead. She joined the flock, and flew off into the distance never to be seen again.\n\n",

Instead, they feed on demons and evil spirits. In particular, they prey upon yōkai which cause disease and spread epidemics. They rip their victims apart violently as they feed, leaving pools of blood and body parts in their wake. Their appetites are as big as the shinchū themselves. Every morning, a shinchū will consume three thousand demons, and every evening it will devour three thousand more.\n\nShinchū are native to the mountains in the southern part of the continent Enbutai (known in English as Jambudvipa) in Indian cosmology. It is the southernmost of the four continents surrounding Shumisen (Mount Meru), the sacred mountain at the center of the cosmos. Enbutai is a forested land, and is the only continent inhabited by humans. It is also the only continent from which achieving enlightenment through study and meditation as a human being is possible. Therefore, shinchū play an important role in protecting humans from evil spirits who might try to interfere in their spiritual development.\n\nOrigin: Silkworm moths are considered holy creatures, and the term shinchū has been used as a poetic name for these insects since ancient times. They were held as miraculous creatures, due to their both their physical transformation from worms into moths, and for the precious silk which they produced.\n\nShinchū’s roots lie in ancient Chinese and Indian religion. They are related to the wrathful deities of Hinduism and Buddhism. The most well known depiction of a shinchū is in a set of five paintings depicting wrathful deities exterminating evil spirits. A shinchū is depicted alongside four other protector gods: Tenkeisei, the god of heavenly punishment, Sendan Kendatsuba, a god of music, protector of children, and member of the Eight Legions, Shōki, the demon queller, and Bishamonten, chief of the Four Heavenly Kings. This set of paintings is revered as a National Treasure of Japan.\n\n",

It has long hair and a scaly body. It has a beak-like mouth, and three legs. It glows with a bright light that can be seen from the shore. They are auspicious yōkai—keeping a picture of an amabie can protect you from disease.\n\nOrigin: Little is known of the amabie’s characteristics. However, its story is very similar to other prophetic yōkai such as jinja hime and kudan, which deliver a prognostication and then disappear. These yōkai began appearing during a period when diseases like cholera were killing people all over the world. Images of protector yōkai that could be used as charms against sicknesses were in high demand. It is very possible that amabie was a sort of copycat yōkai, following the trends of the time.\n\nThe origin of the name amabie is a mystery. There is only one record of amabie in existence, and it appears very similar to another yokai with a similar name: amabiko. There are numerous recorded amabiko sightings, and all of them are minor variations on the same theme: a three-legged creature that appears on the water to deliver a prophecy about abundant harvests and disease. Similarly, amabiko instructs people to spread its image around to protect them from the disease. “Amabie” may have been a simple typographical error, or else it may be a regional variation of the amabiko.\n\nLegends: The only recorded sighting of an amabie comes from Higo Province (present-day Kumamoto prefecture) in April of 1846. For some nights in a row, a bright light could be seen in the waters off shore. One night, a government official went out to see to investigate the strange light. When he approached, a strange creature appeared to him. The creature introduced itself as an amabie. It told the government official that a six-year bumper crop was coming. It also said that should there be an outbreak of disease, he should immediately show the amabie’s picture to people everywhere, as it would protect them against harm. After that, the creature returned to the sea. Shortly after, the amabie’s story along with a woodblock print image of it was featured in the newspaper to be distributed to as many people as possible.\n\n",

Of all the kinds of kitsune, they are the highest ranking. Usually they are described as having lived for one thousand years, possessing golden, silver, or white fur, and multiple (usually four) bushy tails. They are spiritual beings without physical bodies, so their actual appearance depends upon the form they decide to take. They often appear as beautiful human-like goddesses.\n\nBehavior: Kitsune are commonly described as having a ranked hierarchy, with great power and divinity being acquired as they grow older. Additionally, older and more powerful kitsune tend to be benevolent and noble, while lower-ranked kitsune tend to behave wickedly and mischievously. Upon achieving the rank of tenko, a kitsune attains a level of power similar to a god and ceases to commit wicked deeds.\n\nInteractions: Tenko are often worshiped as gods by humans, and they are known to grant boons and favors for the people who revere them. Like other kitsune, tenko can possess humans. When they do so, their host gains the tenko’s power of clairvoyance, and is able to correctly predict any future event.\n\nOrigin: Kitsune folklore originates in the folklore of ancient China, but has been heavily adapted by Japanese writers. In China, foxes were believed to transform into human women, and then use sex to drain men’s life force. A one hundred year old fox would appear as a youthful young beauty, while a thousand year old fox would appear as an insatiable whore. The idea that upon reaching one thousand years, a fox would cease to torment humans and become good, divine spirits also goes back to Chinese folklore, although it is worth noting that in order to achieve that rank, it must first feed off of human life force for one thousand years.\n\nKitsune monogatari, part of the Edo Period essay collection Kyūsensha manpitsu explains that kitsune are divided into two categories: zenko (good foxes) and nogitsune (wild foxes). Tenko are one of the five kinds of good kitsune. The others are kinko (gold foxes), ginko (silver foxes), kuroko (black foxes), and byakko (white foxes).\n\nAnother Edo Period document, Zen’an zuihitsu, defines four categories of kitsune. Nogitsune are the lowest ranking; these are the most wicked, and also the least magical. Kiko (spirit foxes) are higher ranking kitsune who are no longer confined to physical bodies and exist as spirits. Kūko (void foxes) are the second highest rank, possessing twice as much power as kiko. Finally, tenko are the top ranking kitsune, possessing magical powers on par with the gods.\n\n",

They use their beauty to attract young men and destroy them.\n\nBehavior: Hinoenma are paragons of feminine evil and the femme fatales of the yōkai world. They roam cities and streets looking for men (especially young monks) to make into their victims.\n\nInteractions: Men who become enchanted by a hinoenma are quickly ruined. The hinoenma feeds on their virility and their lifeblood, causing them to become weaker and poorer. In the end, the man dies, and the hinoenma moves on to find another victim.\n\nOrigin: East Asian folklore is full of cautionary tales in which hinoenma have used their beauty and charm to destroy men. The falls of three of China’s great dynasties are attributed to yōkai women. Mo Xi was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Xia Dynasty. Daji was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Shang Dynasty. Bao Si was said to be responsible for the collapse of the Western Zhou Dynasty.\n\nHinoenma is a Buddhist term warning about the dangers of beautiful women. Sex with women was viewed as a sin for priests because it was a worldly, carnal pleasure which distracted them from the path of spirituality. Phrases like “bodhisattva on the outside, yasha on the inside” were meant to remind monks that no matter how pleasing a woman looked, her true nature was as dangerous as a demon. This misogyny had multiple implications. Women were considered dangerous both to worldly status and wealth, as well as to spiritual health and religious pursuits. Women eat men’s food, spend men’s money, and drive men into financial and social ruin. On top of that, they force men to focus on worldly things such as sexual desires and material wealth (in order to maintain the extravagant lifestyles women demand), providing barriers to spiritual enlightenment. In other words, if you give a woman your heart, she will steal your soul.\n\nThe name hinoenma itself carries multiple interpretations. Literally translated, the name means “flying fate demon,” Fate in this case refers to the Buddhist concept of nidana, the cause-and-effect chain and birth-death cycle which links all things in the universe. Fate demon means a creature from Buddhist cosmology who tries to disrupt a person’s spiritual progression. Specifically it refers to Mara, the demon king who tried to disrupt the Buddha’s quest for enlightenment by tempting him with beautiful women.\n\nWritten with different characters, hinoenma can mean “fiery Enma,” referring to the king of hell—a hint at what awaits monks who allow themselves to be tempted by women. The name also evokes the phrase hinoe uma—the year of the fire horse—which occurs every 60 years according to the Chinese calendar. Women born in these years were said to be destined to ruin their husbands—a superstition which stems from the legend of Yaoya Oshichi.\n\nLegends: Yaoya Oshichi is the origin of a Japanese superstition about women born in the year of the fire horse. Oshichi was born in Edo in 1666, the year of the fire horse. During the Tenna Era, a great fire erupted at Daienji. Watching the fire, she saw a temple page named Ikuta Shōnosuke and fell in love at first sight. A year later, she attempted to set fire to Daienji in hopes that she would see him again. She was caught, and was burnt at the stake for arson. Since then, it has been believede believed that women born in the year of the fire horse are destined to have furious tempers and eventually destroy their husbands by consuming all that they own. In a testament to the superstition’s continued existence, the most recent year of the fire horse—1966—saw a 25% drop in births compared to the previous and following years. Supposedly weddings have even been cancelled by superstitious families upon finding out that the bride was born in the year of the fire horse.\n\n",

It is most commonly seen in the form of decorative statues in homes and stores. It is depicted with one or both paws in the air in a beckoning motion.\n\nOrigin: Cats have long been connected with the supernatural in Japan. While some superstitions link cats with bad luck, curses, and strange fires, there is also a long tradition of cats being revered and seen as good creatures. Particularly in agricultural and sericulture, where cats would eat mice and other pests who attack crops and silkworms, cats were seen as lucky creatures, and images of cats were used as charms.\n\nStatues of maneki neko became popular items in the urban areas of Japan towards the end of the Edo period. Cats with their right hand raised are said to bring economic fortune, while cats with their left hand raised are said to attract customers. The cat’s colors of the can be significant as well. Long ago, black cats were said to be lucky cats due to their ability to see in the dark, and so black maneki neko were used as talismans against evil spirits. Red was believed to repel smallpox and measles, so red maneki neko were used as talismans against sickness.\n\nThe origins of these statues lie in folkloric tales about strange cats who bring riches to their masters, or who save their masters from disaster. There are a number of famous stories based on variations of these themes.\n\nLegends: In the Yoshiwara please district of Edo, there lived a very famous courtesan named Usugumo. Usugumo was a tayū (the highest rank of oiran) in the esteemed brothel of Miura Yashirōzaemon. Usugumo was a cat lover, and was particularly fond of her tortoiseshell cat whom she always carried with her wherever she went. So great was her love for her cats that rumors began to spread that Usugumo had been possessed or bewitched by a cat.\n\nOne day, as Usugumo tried to visit the bathroom, her tortoiseshell cat began acting extremely clingy. It refused to leave her side, clawing at her dress and meowing noisily. Seeing this, the brothel owner thought that the cat was attacking Usugumo. He quickly drew his sword and slashed at the cat. The cat’s head flew through the air into the bathroom, and sunk its teeth into a large venomous snake which was hiding out of site near the toilet.\n\nUsugumo was overcome with grief for her pet cat, which even in death had saved her life. To ease her sadness, the brothel owner had a statue in the likeness of her cat made by the finest woodcarver out of the finest wood. The carving was so masterfully done and so lifelike that Usugumo was overjoyed and was able to find her happiness once again.\n\nEveryone who saw the carving of the cat wanted one just like it. That year, copies of the figure were sold in the Asakusa markets. This is often thought to be the origin of the maneki neko statue.\n\n \n\n",

They haunt the living by confusing people and coercing them to hang themselves.\n\nBehavior: Itsuki inhabit Meikai, the shadowy underworld where the spirits of the dead dwell. This underworld has a fixed population. In order to maintain equilibrium, a soul may leave to be reborn in the living world only when a new soul arrives to replace them. For this reason, the spirits trapped in hell eagerly await the deaths of the living. Who gets reincarnated is determined by the circumstances in which a person dies. If nobody dies in the same manner, a ghost may have to wait a long time before it can leave the underworld. Itsuki are one such type of ghost.\n\nInteractions: Itsuki grow weary of waiting for people to hang themselves and take their place in hell. So they take matters into their own hands. They haunt the living to drive them to suicide, and take their place in hell. They lurk in the shadows and call out to people when they are alone, commanding them to kill themselves. The impulse which an itsuki implants in its victim is so overpowering that even a happy person with no troubles or worries whatsoever finds themself overcome with the desire to die.\n\nOrigin: Itsuki is a very old superstition, with origins stretching all the way back to the folklore of ancient China. The belief that evil spirits call out to the living to coerce them into suicide remains popular in Japan even today. Urban legends describe people receiving a message from a friend joking that they’re going to go hang themself—only to find out a day later that they actually did it. Suicide notes occasionally mention that the victim heard a ghost calling out to them, telling them to do it. Friends and loved ones lament that there were no warning signs or indications at all that the person was suicidal. And stories about strings of suicides sometimes appear in the news, where one person after another kills themself in a similar manner, with seemingly no connection to the other victims. Such stories are often attributed to evil spirits like itsuki.\n\nLegends: Most itsuki stories follow a similar pattern. A young traveler stopped at an inn overnight. That night, he heard the voice of a young woman muttering something in the adjoining room. Peeking into the room, the traveler saw a woman holding a noose and wrapping it around her neck. In the rafters where the rope was tied, a dark, shadowy figure was perched, cajoling the woman to kill herself. The traveler burst into the room and cut the rope down before she could kill herself. The spirit vanished, and the girl was saved. Afterwards she had no recollection of what she was doing or why she was doing it.\n\nAfamous story comes from Kōjimachi, in old Edo. One evening a rich man held a banquet at his estate. His friend who was supposed to help out with the banquet did not show up. The man waited, and eventually his friend finally appeared, much later than expected. “I’m sorry, but something came up. I just stopped by to tell you I can’t make it tonight.” He turned to leave, but the man stopped him and demanded to know what was so important that he couldn’t help out. “I promised to hang myself from Kuichigai gate,” he replied, and once again turned to leave. The banquet guests thought that the friend had gone mad. They refused to let him leave. Despite his struggles, they held him back, and forced him to drink with them. Eventually, he calmed down and stopped resisting.\n\nLate into the night, a messenger arrived with news that a man had just hanged himself at Kuichigai gate. The guests were shocked. The host became convinced that an itsuki had possessed his friend. The ghost must have grown tired of waiting for him to return from the party, and convinced a different man to kill himself instead.\n\nHe demanded that his friend explain what happened before he arrived. His friend confessed that the night was like a dream, and he could not remember much. He had made his way to Kuichigai gate. A stranger approached him. He heard a voice say: “Hang yourself here and die!” He was unable to resist, but he explained to the stranger that he had a prior engagement. He begged the voice to let him excuse himself from the banquet first. It told him to do so, then quickly return and kill himself. For some reason, he could not refuse. He promised to do as he was commanded, and then came to the party.\n\nThe host’s suspicion was confirmed. He asked his friend if he still wished to kill himself. His friend looked off into the distance and shook with fear. He mimed the motion of wrapping a rope around his own neck and mumbled, “How scary! How scary!”\n\n",

His clothing is old and tattered. He has wild hair and wears a crown on his head. He is the king of the dust heap, but is also sometimes thought of as the king of the tsukumogami—the animated spirits of trash and discarded objects.\n\nBehavior: Chirizuka kaiō appears in picture scrolls depicting the night parade of one hundred demons. In these scrolls he is prying open a Chinese-style chest and releasing a horde of tsukumogami—presumably the objects that were stored in the chest and forgotten.\n\nOrigin: Chirizuka kaiō’s earliest appearance comes from the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573 CE). In the earliest scrolls he is depicted without name or explanation. His name first appears in the Edo period, where he is depicted in Toriyama Sekien’s tsukumogami encyclopedia Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. This book contains a number of yokai based on puns. Chirizuka kaiō’s name appears to be a pun based on essay 72 from Tsurezure gusa, a popular collection of essays from the 14th century. This essay discusses the folly of having too many things—too much furniture in your home, too many pens at your inkstone, too many Buddhas in a temple, too many rocks and trees in a garden, too many children in your home, and so on. However, there is no such thing as having too many books on your book stand, or too much dust upon your dust heap.\n\nIn his description of chirizuka kaiō, Toriyama explains that there is nothing in creation which does not have a leader; the kirin is king of the beasts, the hōō is king of the birds, and so this chirizuka kaiō must be the king of the yama uba. The phrase is actually another pun, and refers to a line from the noh play Yamanba. The line explains that worldly attachments pile up like dust, and if you let them build up into a dust heap then you may turn into a yama uba. Despite this phrasing, chirizuka kaiō has come to be interpreted as the king of tsukumogami rather than yama uba. This is most likely because he appears in Hyakki tsurezure bukuro, which is full of tsukumogami. There is no other connection between chirizuka kaiō and yama uba, as chirizuka kaiō has only ever been depicted releasing yōkai from a chest. Perhaps Toriyama used the word yama uba as an allusion to yōkai born from worldly attachment and ignorance. Yama uba are created when one’s improper attachments pile up like a dust heap. Tsukumogami are born out of forgotten household objects whose owners could not bring themselves to properly dispose of. The same kind of improper attachment is what forms both of these yōkai.\n\n",

They are described as evil kami, minor oni, or yōkai who cause mischief and perform evil deeds. In particular, they are known for provoking humans into acting upon the wicked, impious desires buried deep within their hearts. They spread spiritual pollution wherever they go.\n\nOrigin: Although they predate Buddhism in Japan, amanojaku are frequently depicted in Buddhist imagery as symbols of wickedness being defeated by righteousness. In particular, the Four Heavenly Kings are depicted as standing on top of demons, squashing them—those squashed demons are said to be amanojaku. The god Bishamonten’s armor is also decorated with demonic faces, which are said to be this evil spirit.\n\nAmanojaku originate in ancient mythology. Though their true origins are a mystery, they appear to have developed out of ancient myths of wicked Shinto deities. Amanozako, Amenosagume, and Amenowakahiko all share aspects of this spirit’s undermining nature. It is widely believed that amanojaku originated from one or even all of them.\n\nLegends: The most well-known tale about amanojaku is the story of Uriko hime. In this story, a childless elderly couple discovered a baby girl inside of a melon. They took her home and raised her as their own, and named her Uriko hime. She grew into a beautiful young woman, and one day a request for her hand in marriage arrived. Delighted, her parents went off to town to purchase her dowry and prepare for her wedding. Before leaving, they warned her not to open the door for anybody, no matter what!\n\nShortly afterwards, Uriko hime heard a knock at the door. “Uriko hime, please let me in!” She refused to open the door. The voice replied, “If you won’t open the door, then at least open the window a crack…”\n\nReluctantly, Uriko hime opened the window just a crack. As soon as she had done so, a long, clawed finger slipped into the crack and smashed the window open. It was an amanojaku! The amanojaku leaped at Uriko hime, tearing at her clothes. The young woman fought for her life, biting and kicking at the demon, but she was not strong enough. The amanojaku snapped her neck, and she died.\n\nThe amanojaku didn’t stop there, however. It flayed Uriko hime’s skin and wore it like a suit, hiding itself in her clothes and disguising itself as the young girl. When the girl’s parents came home, they were fooled into thinking their daughter was still alive.\n\nFinally the wedding day arrived. The elderly couple brought the amanojaku-in-disguise to its husband-to-be. However, a crow in a nearby tree called out, warning the couple that their daughter was not what she seemed. They grabbed the bride tight and held her down. They washed her body until the flayed skin sloughed off, and the amanojaku was revealed.\n\nThe amanojaku ran for its life, but the elderly couple chased after it. More and more people joined them, until a whole host of villagers chased the demon through the village. Finally, the townspeople caught up to the amanojaku and hit it with sticks, stones, and tools. They beat the demon into a bloody mess, and it died.\n\n",

They frequently disguise themselves as ordinary humans and then use their belly faces to surprise people and make them laugh.\n\nInteractions: Haradashi appear to sad and lonely individuals, particularly those who are at home drinking alone. Haradashi will slip into these peoples’ houses to cheer them up. When offered a drink, a haradashi happily accepts it, and then bares its belly and performs a ridiculous dance. Those who entertain a haradashi in their homes find that their troubles and worries vanish, and they become filled with hopes and dreams.\n\nHaradashi don’t only perform house calls. They make their homes in old temples and invite in those who need help. They call out to people who are lost or seeking shelter from the snow or rain, and invite them to stay the night in their temple. A haradashi will present its guest with a warm room and a hearty meal, and of course entertain with its signature belly dance.\n\n",

            "content": "加牟波理入道\nかんばりにゅうどうTranslation: kanbari priest; the meaning is unknown\nAlternate names: ganbari nyūdō\nHabitat: bathrooms\nDiet: omnivorousAppearance: Kanbari nyūdō is a perverted ghost-like yōkai which lurks outside of bathrooms on New Year’s Eve. It has a roughly priest-like appearance, with robes and a tonsured haircut. Its body is covered in thick hairs. Kanbari nyūdō blows a cuckoo out of its mouth. As it only comes out once per year, very little is known about this yōkai.\n\nInteractions: There are many conflicting accounts about what kanbari nyūdō actually does. What is certain is that it lurks outside of bathrooms on New Year’s Eve, and peeks into the window at people using the toilet. What happens next varies from place to place. In general, this yōkai brings bad luck in the coming year. In more recent stories, kanbari nyūdō tries to stroke or lick the person using the toilet. Sometimes, it inflicts constipation upon those who see it.\n\nOrigin: Kanbari nyūdō’s history and origins are confused and convoluted. According to Toriyama Sekien, this yōkai originally comes from the Chinese god of the toilet, Kakutō. Because the characters used to write Kakutō are similar to the characters used to write the Japanese word for cuckoo, this may have been intended as a pun on Sekien’s part. However, Kakutō was not, in fact, a Chinese toilet god. He was actually a 15th century Ming general.\n\nThe cuckoo connection does actually trace back to China. It was considered bad luck to hear a cuckoo’s call in the toilet—if you hear a cuckoo while using the toilet, you have to bark like a dog to counter the curse.\n\nThis yōkai’s name is also a mystery. It can be written in many different ways using many different kanji, although none of them have a particular meaning. They appear to be ateji—kanji chosen solely for their phonetic readings. Jippensha Ikku, an Edo period author, wrote about ganbari nyūdō using kanji meaning “stretched eyes”—very appropriate considering this yōkai’s propensity for peeping. However, as no earlier stories use those kanji for the name, it is certainly his own (very clever) fabrication. Ganbari may also be connected to the word ganbaru, which means to try hard and persevere—which may or may not be related to certain bathroom activities. But this is almost certainly a connection made after the fact, rather than being the origin of this yōkai’s name.\n\nLegends: Stories about kanbari nyūdō differ wildly from region to region. According to some local legends, if you enter an outhouse on New Year’s Eve at the hour of the ox, between 1 and 3 am, and peer down into the hole and chant “ganbari nyūdō” three times, a human head will appear in the hole. If you then take that head and insert it into your left kimono sleeve and then take it back out, it will turn into a koban—an oval-shaped gold coin. In other regions, the human head must instead be wrapped up inside of a silk cloth and taken back to one’s room. When the cloth is unwrapped, it will be filled with gold.\n\nIn most areas, kanbari nyūdō are thought to be bringers of bad luck. If one enters the toilet on New Year’s Eve and chants the spell, “ganbari nyūdō, hototogisu!” (“ganbari priest, cuckoo!”) this yōkai will not appear, and thus the following year will not be unlucky. On the other hand, in other areas, chanting the same phrase or even remembering those magic words is unlucky enough to guarantee an entire year of bad luck.\n\n",

They appear in bodies of water around Kyūshū on dark, calm nights—particularly at the end of the 7th month according to the old lunar calendar. They are most visible during the strongest ebb tide, around 3 am, and appear roughly 8 to 12 kilometers off shore. They can be seen from elevated parts of the coast, but not from sea level.\n\nBehavior: Shiranui begin with one or two distant fireballs, called oyabi, floating just above the surface of the sea. The oyabi sway left and right, splitting apart and multiplying until finally there are hundreds or thousands of fireballs swaying in the distance. This line of fireballs can stretch out for many kilometers.\n\nOrigin: Shiranui were thought to be manifestations of the lanterns created by Ryūjin, the dragon god of the sea. On days that shiranui appeared, local villages were forbidden to catch fish in the same area as the kaika.

They guard the bridge and the banks of the Sanzu River. All souls must pass by them before moving on to Meido to be judged.\n\nINTERACTION: During a Japanese funeral, 6 mon (an old form of currency) are placed in the coffin to be used as a toll to enter the underworld. Upon reaching the Sanzu River, the souls must cross either by bridge (if they were good in life), by wading in the shallows (if they were only somewhat good), or by swimming across the deepest part of the river (if they were wicked).\n\nAfter crossing the river, each soul encounters Datsueba, who accepts the toll and strips the souls of the clothes on their backs. Datsueba hands the clothing to her partner, Keneō, who hangs it from a tree by the riverside. The amount that the branch bends under the weight of the clothes serves as a measure of the weight of the sin each soul carries, and is used as evidence in the trials to come. Of course, the clothes of those who had to ford the river or swim across are heavy and wet, which only makes the branches of the tree sag lower. If a soul arrives with no clothes, Keneō flays his or her skin and hangs it from the tree instead.\n\nDatsueba and Keneō perform a little bit of torture themselves, breaking the fingers of those guilty of theft, and so on. They also roam the banks of the river, tormenting the souls of children who are too young to cross the river and must wait for salvation to come to them instead.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Datsueba is the wife of King Enma. In the Edo period, she became a popular object of folk worship, and temples dedicated to her began to spring up around Japan. Prayers and charms dedicated to Datsueba were used as wards against disease and coughs, in particular for children’s coughs.\n\n",

They appear as ordinary humans for the most part, except their features are more monstrous. They have sharp, pointed teeth which they use to peel the flesh off of the recently deceased.\n\nBehavior: Jikininki are found near villages, usually in abandoned temples or old ruins. They avoid excessive contact with humans, but remain close to human settlements, as humans are their main source of food. Jikininki gain their sustenance by devouring the flesh and bones of the recently deceased. They do not enjoy their existence and do not find pleasure in eating the dead. It merely temporarily relieves some of the pain of their eternal hunger.\n\nJikininki exist somewhere between the living and the dead. They exhibit some ghost-like traits; they and their dwellings are often invisible during the day, appearing only to unsuspecting travelers during the night. They usually hunt their prey at night as well, slipping into temples when the dead are lain there for funerary prayers.\n\nORIGINS: Jikininki are closely related to gaki—hungry ghosts of Buddhist cosmology who are constantly starving but unable to eat anything. A jikininki is born when a person performs evil deeds, corrupting his soul. Some jikiniki were corrupt priests who could not properly pass on after their deaths. Others were once humans who, for some reason or another, developed a taste for human flesh. As time went on and they continued eating people, they gradually transformed into these monsters.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a monk named Musō Soseki was traveling on a pilgrimage when he became lost deep in the mountains. As day began to fade, he came across a dilapidated old hermitage, where an elderly monk gave him directions to a village not far away. Soseki traveled on, and just as night fell he arrived in the village.\n\nThe son of the village chief welcomed Soseki and invited him to stay in his house as a guest. “However,” he said, “my father passed away earlier today. In our village, we have a custom. When one of us dies, we all must spend the night away from the village. If we do not do this, we will be cursed. But you are tired from your journey, and seeing as you are a priest, and also not a member of this village, I see no reason why you too must leave. Please feel free to stay in my house this night while the rest of us leave the village.” Soseki gratefully accepted. The villagers all left the village, and Soseki was alone.\n\nThat night, the monk recited funerary prayers over the body of the village chief. All of a sudden, he felt a presence nearby. Soseki felt his body freeze up, and he was unable to move. Then, a dark, hazy shape crept through the house and up to the body. The creature devoured the remains of the village chief, and then slipped away as quietly as it had arrived.\n\nThe following morning, when the villagers returned, Soseki told them what he had seen during the night. The village chief’s son told him that this was just as the local legends say. Soseki was surprsied, and asked why the monk living in the hermitage did not perform the funeral prayers for the village. The village chief’s son seemed confused. “There is no hermitage nearby. What’s more, there haven’t been any monks in this region for many generations…”\n\nSoseki traced his steps through the mountains to the old hermitage he had seen the night before. The old monk welcomed him into the hovel and told him, “I apologize for showing you such a sight last night. The monster you saw in the village chief’s house was me. Long, long ago I was a priest. I lived in that village, and I performed many funeral services for the dead. However, all I could think of was the payment for my services, and not the souls of the deceased. Because of my lack of conviction, when I died I was reborn as a jikininki. Now, I am forced to feed off the bodies of the dead. Please, save my soul and release me from my torment!”\n\nIn that instant, the elderly monk and the dilapidated old hermitage both disappeared. Soseki was sitting on the dirt, surrounded by tall grass. The only feature nearby was an ancient, moss-covered gravestone.\n\n",

However, they are bigger, more vicious, and much smarter. They can speak, and sometimes they are seen wearing human clothes as well. They are thought to be the remnants of an ancient monkey worshiping cult. All that is left of this religion today are wicked monkey spirits who have degenerated into yōkai.\n\nBehavior: Sarugami behave for the most part like wild monkeys. They live in the mountains and tend to stay away from human-inhabited areas.\n\nInteractions: When sarugami interact with humans it almost always ends in violence. Most legends follow a similar pattern: a sarugami kidnaps a young woman from a villager, and heroes are called upon to go into the wilderness and exterminate the sarugami. Like oni, giant snakes, and other monsters, sarugami are beasts meant to be slain by brave samurai.\n\nOrigin: According to folklorist Yanagita Kunio, sarugami are a prime example of “fallen” gods—spirits once revered as gods, but who have since been forgotten. These beliefs never entirely vanish, though, and such spirits often remain as degenerate versions of their former selves, i.e. yōkai. Long ago, before Buddhism arrived, monkeys were worshiped as gods in parts of Japan. The southern part of Lake Biwa in modern-day Shiga Prefecture was an important center of monkey worship, based at Hiyoshi Taisha. Monkeys were seen as messengers and servants of the sun, in part because they become most active at sunrise and sunset. Because of this, monkey worship was popular among farmers, who also awoke and retired with the sun. Over the centuries, as farming technology improved, people became less reliant on subsistence farming. More and more people took up professions other than farming. As a result, monkey worship began to fade away, and the monkey gods were forgotten. Today, monkeys are viewed as pests by farmers, as they dig up crops, steal food from gardens, and sometimes even attack pets and small children.\n\nThough the early monkey cults have vanished, sarugami worship continued throughout the middle ages in esoteric religions such as Kōshin. Monkeys came to be viewed as servants of the mountain deities, or as mountain deities themselves, acting as intermediaries between the world we live in and the heavens. The famous three wise monkey statues—mizaru, kikazaru, and iwazaru (“see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil”)—come from Kōshin and are a prime example of sarugami worship.\n\nAn apocryphal legend says that long ago the Buddha appeared at Hiyoshi Taisha. Just before this occurred, a large gathering of monkeys arrived in the area. The Buddha took the form of a monkey, and foretold the fortunes of the faithful worshipers at Hiyoshi Taisha. Thousands of years earlier, Cang Jie—the legendary inventor of Chinese writing (c. 2650 BCE)—foresaw this appearance of the Buddha. Thus, when he invented the word for god (神), he constructed it out of characters meaning indicate (示) and monkey (申) to foretell this event. In other words, “monkey indicates god.” Although entertaining, this is a false etymology, and the true origin of the word for gods has nothing to do with monkeys.\n\nLegends: In Mimasaka Provice (present-day Okayama Prefecture) there was a giant monkey who lived in the mountains. Every year this sarugami would demand a sacrifice of a young woman from the villages around the mountain. One year, a hunter happened to be staying at the house of the young woman who was chosen to be that year’s sacrifice. Her family was devastated at the thought of losing their daughter, and the hunter took pity on them. He volunteered to take her place as a sacrifice. The hunter and his dog were loaded into a large chest and taken up into the mountains by some priests to be delivered to the sarugami. After some time, a giant sarugami more than two meters tall emerged from the woods, along with his entourage of over one hundred monkeys. The hunter and his dog leaped from the chest and attacked. One by one, the monkeys fell, until only the sarugami remained. Just then the creature possessed one of the priests and spoke through him. The sarugami asked for forgiveness and promised never to demand another sacrifice. The hunter allowed to sarugami to run away, and the sarugami has never asked for another sacrifice since.\n\nIn Ōmi Provice (present-day Shiga Prefecture) there lived an elderly farmer and his young daughter. The farmer toiled in his fields to exhaustion every day, while his daughter waited to be married off. But there were no suitors. One day, the farmer mumbled to himself, “Even a monkey would be ok, if only there was someone I could marry my daughter to so they would come work in my field!” Just then a giant monkey appeared and completed all of the old man’s farm work. The following day, the sarugami returned and demanded the old man’s daughter as payment for his work. When the old man refused, the saru grew angry at him for breaking his word, and he stole the man’s daughter and ran into the mountains. Back in his den, the sarugami kept the daughter tied up in a sack. Meanwhile, the old man begged a local noble to rescue his daughter. One day, while the sarugami was away from his den, the noble snuck in and freed the girl. In her place, he put his dog in the sack. When the sarugami returned to his den later he opened the sack to check on his prisoner. The dog leaped out and killed him.\n\n",

They merely dance about in wild and ritualistic movements like the dances in which they were once used as holy instruments.\n\nOrigin: Bells have been used since ancient times in Shintō rituals to calm the human soul as well as repel evil spirits. Most importantly, they are meant to attract the attention of the gods and call forth their presence. Although it is not specifically stated, it is possible that suzuhiko hime, like other tsukumogami, are born out of old tools that are no longer in service, animating themselves from the desire to be useful once again.\n\nSuzuhiko hime is a creation of Toriyama Sekien, and first appears in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Everything about this yōkai, from the meaning of its name, to what Sekien intended for it to do, can only be inferred from his brief description of it.\n\nSekien’s description of suzuhiko hime refers to a famous scene from Japanese mythology. Amaterasu, the sun goddess, had a violent quarrel with her brother Suzano’o, the god of storms, and hid herself from the other gods in the cave Ama no Iwato. Without the sun, everything became cold and dark. The gods gathered outside of the cave and begged Amaterasu to come out, but she refused. Eventually, Ame no Uzume, the goddess of dawn and revelry, came up with a plan. She stood upon an upturned tub and performed a wild, erotic dance, stripping naked and baring herself to the other gods. Their loud, uproarious cheering could be heard by Amaterasu deep inside the cave. Eventually her curiosity got the better of her, and she left the cave to see what the commotion was about. The other gods quickly blocked the cave entrance so she could not go back inside, and light was returned to the heavens and the earth.\n\nAme no Uzume’s performance is said to be the origin of kagura, the sacred music and dance of Shintō rituals. And kagura in turn indirectly serves as the origin of this yōkai.\n\n",

Not much is known about this fearsome beast aside from its hunting practices. The shōkera is believed to be some kind of demon with connections to Kōshin, an esoteric Japanese folk religion with origins in Taoism.\n\nInteractions: Shōkera only appear on special nights in the Kōshin faith which occurs every sixty nights. A shōkera spies through windows, doorways, or skylights in houses, and hunts for impious behavior. Then it pounces down in a vicious attack. Because Kōshin is no longer a widespread religion—and because victims of shōkera attacks would only be implicating themselves as wicked by admitting to seeing one—little else is known about the shōkera.\n\nOrigin: According to Kōshin, there are three spiritual worms or insects, called the sanshi, which live inside every human body. Every sixty nights, on a special night called kōshin machi, these worms leave the body while their host human sleeps. The sanshi travel to heaven to report on the good and bad deeds of their human. The emperor of heaven then uses this information to lengthen or shorten people’s lives according to their deeds. While good people have nothing to fear from kōshin machi, the wicked might try to circumvent having their bad deeds reported by staying awake and reciting prayers all night long during these special nights so that the sanshi cannot leave the body. That’s when the shōkera goes to work. It lurks about on rooftops during these nights, peers into windows, and hunts for anyone violating the laws of heaven.\n\n",

They look vaguely human, but they have distended, bulging bellies and tiny, inefficient mouths and throats. They inhabit a parallel realm called Gakidō. It is a barren place, full of deserts, wastelands, and other inhospitable terrain.\n\nBehavior: Gaki are eternally hungry and thirsty. There are many kinds of gaki, each of which suffers in a different way related to the sins he or she committed in a past life. Some are unable to eat or drink anything at all. Whenever they try to eat, the food instantly bursts into flames and vanishes. These gaki are only able to eat food which has been specially blessed for them in Buddhist services. Some gaki are able to eat only unclean things, such as feces, vomit, corpses, and so on. Others have no trouble eating anything they please. However, no matter how much they wolf down, their hunger and thirst are never sated.\n\nINTERACTION: In some Buddhist traditions, a special ceremony called segaki is performed during the Obon season, to help ease the suffering of the gaki. In this ceremony, offerings of rice and water are laid out on special altars, out of sight of any statues of the gods or Buddha. The gaki are called to come and eat, while prayers are said to ease some of their suffering.\n\nOrigin: The realm of the gaki is considered one of the four “unhappy” rebirths. In the cosmology of birth and rebirth, the realm of the gaki is only one step above the realm of Jigoku—the main difference between the inhabitants of Jigoku and the gaki being that those in Jigoku are confined to their prison. Gaki may roam free as they suffer.\n\nToday, the word gaki is also a very nasty term for a child. This comes from the perception of children always wanting more food and never feeling satisfied with what they get.\n\n",

His story is a famous example of umatsuki—possession by a horse spirit.\n\nOrigin: Shio no Chōjirō’s story is an old and well known tale with many variations. Perhaps it’s most famous appearance is in the Edo Period collection of illustration stories Ehon hyakumonogatari, however it was a well known tale before then, with variations all over Japan. It may have been inspired in part by famous performance magician who lived in the late 17th century named Shioya Chōjirō. Shioya Chōjirō could perform sword swallowing and other tricks, but was best known for his mastery of of donbajutsu (“horse swallowing technique”) in which he would swallow a live horse before an audience. Illustrations of his performances appear to have been used as the basis for his illustration in Ehon hyakumonogatari.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Oshio no Ura, Kaga Province lived a very wealthy man named Chōjirō. Chōjirō was quite fond of eating meat—a practice which was taboo in feudal Japan. His household kept over 300 horses. Every time one of his horses died, he would pickle its meat in salt or miso to enjoy at his leisure. Thanks to this, he always had plenty of sinful meat to eat.\n\nGradually, Chōjirō’s horses began to dwindle, and consequently so did his stock of pickled horse meat. One the day that his supply of meat ran out, Chōjirō selected an old horse that was no longer capable of working. He slaughtered and ate it. That was the moment Chōjirō’s life changed. From then on, he was haunted by the old horse’s ghost.\n\nEvery night, the old horse appeared before Chōjirō in his dreams and snapped at his throat. Further, every evening at the very minute that Chōjirō slaughtered the horse, it’s vengeful ghost would appear before him. It would force itself down his throat and into his stomach, where it would violently thrash about.\n\nChōjirō’s suffering was unbearable. He developed a high fever and began to hallucinate. He screamed and babbled, confessing all of his life’s sins in painful delirium. Doctors examined him and priests prayed for him, but nothing helped. He descended into madness and his condition deteriorated.\n\nOne hundred days after his haunting began, Chōjirō finally succumbed to the horse’s curse. When he died, it is said that his body was bent like that of an old horse who had spent a lifetime carrying heavy loads.\n\n",

Someone who takes off their shoes in a melon patch or fiddles with their hat under a plum tree might give the impression that they are stealing fruit in their shoes or under their hat.

They fly through the air while remaining in a seated pose.\n\nOrigin: Osakōburi was invented by Toriyama Sekien and appears in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Its description references an ancient Chinese story from The Book of the Later Han in which a court official named Wang Mang usurped the Chinese throne to become emperor. One of the court’s councilors, a man named Feng Meng, thought it would be impious to serve an usurper, and quit his post. In a very public act of protest, he hung his hat on the eastern gate of the city. Sekien contrasts Feng Meng’s noble and very risky act with somebody who shamefully clings to his hat and rank, hiding behind their prestige in order to protect himself. Only the hat of such a cowardly noble, Sekien says, would transform into a yōkai like osakōburi.\n\n",

Shachihoko live in colder, norther oceans. They are able to swallow massive amounts of water with a single gulp and hold it in their bellies. They are also able to summon clouds and control the rain.\n\nInteractions: Shachihoko are often found adorning the rooftops of Japanese castles, temples, gates, and samurai residences. They are placed facing each other on opposite ends of a roof. They serve as protector spirits, similar to the oni roof tiles also commonly found on castles. It was believed that in the event of a fire, the shachihoko could protect the building by summoning rain clouds or by spitting out the massive amounts of water they had previously swallowed.\n\nOrigin: Shachihoko as an element of construction evolved from shibi, large, ornamental roof end tiles. Shibi originated in China during the Jin dynasty and were popularized in Japan during the Nara and Heian periods. During the Sengoku period, when castles rapidly began appearing all over Japan, shibi were reimagined as large fish, and the image of the shachihoko was popularized. From them on, shachihoko remained popular elements of Japanese roof construction.\n\nThe shachihoko’s origins may go even further back, to India. In Hindu mythology, there is a large sea monster named Makara who is half-fish and half-beast (sometimes depicted as an elephant, a deer, a crocodile, or another animal). Makara was a powerful protector and servant of various deities. Images of Makara were commonly used in temple architecture, particularly over archways and doorways, or as rain spouts. Japanese versions of Makara tend to resemble the shachihoko more than they resemble the original Hindu creature.\n\nToday, the Japanese word for the orca is shachi—no doubt because of its similarity to this creature.\n\n",

In general, they look like humans with a grey, corpse-like pallor and horrifying features. Although their name includes the word kami, their true nature is closer to that of a ghost or an evil spirit than a god.\n\nBehavior: Shinigami are attracted to death. They lurk around the bodies of the recently deceased. They thrive in areas which are have been tainted by evil—especially places where grizzly deaths such as murders or suicides have occurred. They haunt these impure areas looking for humans to haunt.\n\nInteractions: Shinigami are spirits of possession, or tsukimono, which haunt people and alter their behavior. Their victims become obsessed with death and the desire to kill themselves. They obsess over any and every bad thing they may have done, fueling their desire to commit suicide. Shinigami are particularly find of possessing wicked people, however anyone unfortunate enough to see a shinigami is doomed to suffer an unnatural and violent death.\n\nLocal areas have many different superstitions regarding shinigami and how to deal with them. For example, in Kumamoto Prefecture it is believed that anyone attending an overnight vigil with a recently deceased body will be followed home by a shinigami. Upon returning home, you must have a cup of tea or a bowl of rice and lie down to sleep, or else the shinigami will possess you.\n\nOrigin: Shinigami are related to a common folk belief that evil begets evil. If a murder or a suicide takes place in a certain area, there is sure to be another murder or suicide in that same area soon. Bloodshed and tragedy can repeat over and over again until an area is ritually purified and the souls of any victims appeased. This theme is present in ancient legends such as the Tale of the Heikei, to medieval ghost stories, and even modern urban legends and film. Shinigami are a key part of this cycle; the souls of the wicked dead call to the souls of the wicked living, goading them to commit further atrocities. Unless properly exorcised, this circle of death can continue forever.\n\n",

The paper sliding doors and windows of traditional Japanese homes are particularly good at catching kage onna shadows in the moonlight.\n\nBehavior: Kage onna make no sound, nor do they interact with the house or its inhabitants.

If the door or window is opened to see who or what created the shadow, there will be nothing waiting in the dark. However, tradition says that a house where a kage onna is seen is likely haunted—or will soon be haunted—by other yōkai as well.\n\nOrigin: The moonlight frequently plays tricks on the eyes, causing people to see things in the darkness that aren’t really there. The bright moon casts eerie shadows on the ground and walls that don’t seem like they should fit. Most of the time, this can be attributed to an overactive mind piecing together ghost stories and wandering thoughts, or constructing some horrible figment of the imagination.

They have varied forms, but generally are humanoid in appearance, with brightly colored skin, spiked hair, sharp teeth, and fierce eyes. They are usually depicted carrying weapons and wearing ornate armor.\n\nBehavior: Yasha are one of the members of the the Eight Legions–eight supernatural races who listened to the sermons of Shaka Nyōrai and converted to Buddhism. Along with the ten, ryū, kendatsuba, ashura, karura, kinnara, and magoraka, they serve as guardians of the Buddhist teachings.\n\nYasha serve Buddhism in a number of ways. Most importantly, the Twelve Heavenly Generals (the twelve most fearsome yasha), serve as the personal bodyguards of Yakushi Nyōrai, the buddha of medicine. They wage war on sickness and fight the enemies of Buddhism. They are also important in astrology–as there are twelve of them, they are associated with the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac, the hours of the day, the months, and the directions. Their leader, General Kubira, is also an important kami in the Shinto faith. He is believed to be the manifestation of Konpira, a god of fishing, seafaring, and farming. He is enshrined as Ōmononushi in the Kotohira shrine of Kagawa Prefecture, alongside Sutoku Tennō.\n\nYasha, along with another kind of demon called rasetsu, are used as soldiers in the armies of Bishamonten, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. Bishamonten is often depicted trampling a tiny, evil yasha (called a jaki or amanojaku) under his feet. His armor is also often decorated with scowling yasha faces. In this way yasha also serve as a symbol the triumph of virtue over wickedness.\n\nOrigin: Yasha come from Hindu mythology. They were originally benevolent nature spirits and caretakers of the trees and earth. In Buddhism, they were interpreted as evil, ghost-like spirits who preyed upon travelers, but later gave up their wicked ways upon hearing the sermons of the Buddha. The Buddhist version of yasha is very similar to another class of Hindu spirits: the ogrish, man-eating demons known as rasetsu. When Buddhism was brought into China, it mixed with Chinese folk religion and astrology, and yasha grew even further away from their Hindu origins.\n\nWhen Buddhism was brought to Japan from China, the Chinese interpretation of yasha was brought along with it. In Japan, yasha were often viewed as Buddhist manifestations of local evil spirits, like amanojaku and oni. Yasha took on some of the characteristics of these spirits, and sometimes even became synonymous with them.\n\n",

They are the servants of Ryūgū, the palace of the sea dragon king.\n\nOrigin: Jinja hime was first sighted in Hizen Province (present-day Saga and Nagasaki Prefectures) in 1819 by the Edo period scholar Katō Ebian. He recorded the encounter in his book Waga koromo. According to Katō, he encountered a fish-like creature on a beach in Hizen. The creature spoke to him: “I am a messenger from Ryūgū, called jinja hime. For the next seven years there will be a bumper crop. After that, there will be an epidemic of cholera. However, those who see my picture will be able to avoid hardship, and instead will have long life.” After delivering her prophecy, the jinja hime disappeared into the sea. Katō printed an illustration of the jinja hime in Waga koromo so that all could see it and be protected.\n\nThe news of the jinja hime and her prognostication became so popular that it spawned numerous copycat stories across Japan. Not long after the sighting of jinja hime, stories about other yokai with foresight, such as kudan and amabie, began popping up all over Japan. Jinja hime is thought to be the basis for all of these stories.\n\nThe giant oarfish strongly resembles the size and description of jinja hime.

Its inhabitants can practice Buddhism directly under Amida’s tutelage, listen to the songs of karyōbinga, and achieve enlightenment themselves.\n\n",

When a daki spots a person cooking fish on a seaside bonfire, she approaches them like a beggar and asks them to give her a fish. Whether they say yes or no doesn’t matter; a daki is only interested in getting close to them. Once she is within range she attacks, draining the lifeblood from their body.\n\nInteractions: The fishermen of Saga’s islands are particularly fearful of daki. As a result, they have a particular way of securing their boats when stopping on an island to cook fish. They only drop the anchor, and do not tie up the boat with mooring lines. This way, if they need to escape in a hurry, they can simply cut the anchor line and be off.\n\nOrigin: Daki come from the folklore of Kakarashima, an island off the northern coast of Saga Prefecture. They are a local version of an iso onna—yōkai women found across Japan who appear near the seaside and feed upon sailors and fishermen. The name daki is a local variation of dangai, meaning cliffs.\n\nLegends: A fisherman and his two sons went swimming off an island one day. After some time, they went to shore and lit a bonfire. Before long, a strange woman approached them and said, “Please give me a fish.”\n\nThe father was an experienced fisherman. He knew about daki and was immediately suspicious of the strange woman. He turned to his children and said, “Go back to the boat. Fetch a fish and bring it here.”\n\nThe children went to the boat, but since they had been swimming, not fishing, there were no fish. They called back, “We can’t find any fish!”\n\nThe father feigned confusion and said, “That can’t be! Let me see…” Then he made his way to the boat as if to help the children. When all three were in the boat, the father suddenly cut the anchor line and the boat was pulled out to sea.\n\nThe woman ran to the edge of the island and screamed angrily. “Yargh! I almost had you!”\n\n",

Hane no haeta kappa, however, are a breed of kappa which bear a closer resemblance to chickens or pheasants. Their hind legs are clawed and bird-like, and instead of arms they have wings. Their bodies are covered in long, hair-like feathers, and they have long necks which can stretch.\n\nBehavior: Hane no haeta kappa live in wetlands such as ponds, marshes, and swamps. Despite their unusual appearance, they are very much like regular kappa.\n\nInteractions: Just as ordinary kappa are sometimes aggressive and dangerous towards humans, hane no haeta kappa are not without their dangers. These yōkai occasionally attack people—children in particular—who stray too close to their territory.\n\nLegends: A hane no haeta kappa was reported in the village of Yanagisawa (present-day Tsuruoka City, Yamagata Prefecture) in the summer of 1840. The creature lived in a nearby pond and had attacked two children from the village. On June 26, the villagers drained the pond and captured the kappa.

They walk upright on two legs like humans and dress in Buddhist priest robes. They are found by mountain streams where people fish for iwana and other river fish.\n\nBehavior: Iwana live in rivers and streams high up in the mountains. Iwana which survive for many years and grow to an enormous size become iwana bōzu. They learn to transform into human shape, leave their rivers, and even speak.\n\nInteractions: Iwana bōzu appear out of nowhere and ask people who are fishing to stop and go home. They usually approach people catching more fish than they need to survive rather than those who are just feeding their families. In particular, they target those who use extreme measures of fishing, such as poisoning the river with Japanese pepper (Zanthoxylum piperitum), which causes fish to float to surface and makes them easy to catch. They lecture about refraining from needless killing, and taking life only when it is necessary to survive, and so on. Because they dress and speak in a manner that resembles a Buddhist priest, they are usually not immediately recognized as yōkai. It is only until later, after departing, that something seems off or strange and you realize that the person you thought was a priest was in fact a yōkai.\n\nOrigin: Iwana bōzu stories can be found in all parts of Japan. In some areas, other fish species such as yamame (Oncorhynchus masou masou) and unagi (eels, Anguilla japonica) are also said to transform into people and admonish humans against cruel and excessive fishing. These stories vary in several details but all follow a similar narrative pattern. Common to all of them is the ending, in which the fish is killed and cut open, the contents of its stomach revealing its yōkai nature.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Gifu, several young men were fishing by a stream. They were using poison techniques to catch a large quantity of fish. While they took a break for lunch, a Buddhist priest with a shiny bald head suddenly appeared out of nowhere and approached the group. The priest asked the young men if they were fishing with poison.\n\nThe young men replied that yes, they were using poison.\n\nThe priest asked them to stop fishing in that manner. It was a bad way to fish. It was cruel, and it caused excess death, which is a sin.\n\nThe young men protested that they had their own livelihoods to think of. But the priest persisted, and admonished them not to take unnecessary life. Eventually, out of politeness, they agreed to stop fishing with poison. The priest seemed satisfied, and the young men offered him some dango to eat. The priest gratefully accepted the food and then left.\n\nAfter they finished lunch, the men went back to fishing. Despite what they had told the priest, they had no intention to stop using poison. Suddenly, the largest fish they had ever seen—over 180 cm in length—appeared in the river! They threw more and more poison into the river and were able to catch the giant fish.\n\nGleefully, the young men returned to their village laden with a huge catch. They decided to make a feast of the giant fish. As they prepared the fish, they cut open its stomach and out tumbled the dango that they had given to the priest!\n\nThe young men were so frightened that not one of them was willing to eat the fish.\n\n",

They can spit fire from their mouths.\n\nBehavior: Akugyo spend most of their time beneath the seas, so little is known of their natural behavior.\n\nInteractions: Although akugyo sightings are rare, they are feared by fishermen nonetheless. Boats can get stuck on their large backs. Eventually the boats capsize, and the akugyo eats everyone who was on board.\n\nLegends: An akugyo was sighted in the Sea of Japan, off the coast of Echigo Province (present day Toyama Prefecture) in 1805. Its body was approximately 11 meters long, and its horns measured over 60 centimeters long. It was vanquished by Lord Matsudaira of Kaga, who sent 1500 men and 450 guns to slay it.\n\nA famous taiko master from Kaga, Izutsuya Kanroku, was on a boat in the Sea of Japan when suddenly the boat stopped moving. It had sailed over the back of an akugyo and gotten stuck. Kanroku was sure he was doomed. With nothing to do but wait for death, he played his with all of his remaining energy.

These animals normally grow up to one and a half meters long, however the yōkai versions of this animal can grow much larger. They have rough, mottled, brown and black skin, tiny eyes, and enormous mouths which span the entire width of their heads. They live in rivers and streams far from human-inhabited areas.\n\nInteractions: Hanzaki and humans rarely come into contact with each other. When they do, it is usually because the hanzaki has grown large enough to eat humans or livestock and is causing trouble to nearby villagers.\n\nOrigin: The name hanzaki is a colloquialism for the Japanese giant salamander. They are called hanzaki for their regenerative powers; it was believed that a salamander’s body could be cut (saku) in half (han) and it would still survive. The call of the salamander was said to resemble that of a human baby, and so the word is written with kanji combining fish (魚) and child (兒).\n\nLegends: There was once a deep pool in which a gigantic hanzaki lived. The hanzaki would grab horses, cows, and even villagers, drag them into the pool, and swallow them in a single gulp. For generations, the villagers lived in fear of the pool and stayed away from it.\n\nDuring the first year of Bunroku (1593 CE), the villagers called for help, asking if there was anyone brave enough to slay the hanzaki. A young villager named Miura no Hikoshirō volunteered. Hikoshirō grabbed his sword and dove into the pool. He did not come back up; he had been swallowed by the hanzaki in a single gulp! Moments later, Hikoshirō sliced through the hanzaki and tore it in half from the inside out, killing it instantly. The slain creature’s body was 10 meters long, and 5 meters in girth!\n\nThe very day the hanzaki was slain, strange things began to happen at the Miura residence. Night after night, something would bang on the door, and something screaming and crying could be heard just outside the door. However, when Hikoshirō opened the door to check, there was nothing there at all.\n\nNot long after that, Hikoshirō and his entire family died suddenly. Strange things began to happen through the village as well. The villagers believed the angry ghost of the dead hanzaki had cursed them. They built a small shrine and enshrined the hanzaki’s spirit as a god, dubbing it Hanzaki Daimyōjin. After that, the hanzaki’s spirit was pacified, and the curse laid to rest.\n\nA gravestone dedicated to Miura no Hikoshirō still stands in Yubara, Okayama Prefecture. The villagers of Yubara still honor Hanzaki Daimyōjin by building giant salamander shrine floats and parading them through town during the annual Hanzaki Festival.\n\n \n\n",

Because of this and their long life span, they are a symbol of long life and prosperity and appear frequently in paintings, sculpture, and handicrafts.\n\nLegends: According to a legend from Iwate Prefecture, three young men were fishing in a pond when all of a sudden an enormous minogame with hair all over its head and body rose out of the water. The turtle opened its mouth and expelled a cloud of toxic gas all over the young men. They were terrified and ran back to their homes.

Her perpetual youth and beauty were attained by accidentally eating the flesh of a ningyo—which is said to grant eternal life.\n\nOrigin: Yaobikuni’s story is found over and over again in almost every region of Japan. Some details of her story vary from place to place, but the main points remain the same: a girl unknowingly eats something from the undersea world which causes her to live for a very long time, so she becomes a nun and travels around Japan. In many versions the girl is the daughter of a poor fisherman, while in some she is the daughter of a local noble, or even the daughter of legendary onmyōji Ashiya Dōman. In some versions of the story she becomes immortal by eating the flesh of a ningyo, in other versions it is a magical abalone or some other special food from Ryūgū. Across Japan there are towns with stories about trees that were planted by a traveling immortal nun centuries ago. There are official records of an eight-hundred year old nun visiting in Kyōto in 1449. In most tales, she finally ends up in Wakasa—southern Fukui Prefecture. It is possible that is where her story originated. A small cave located on the grounds of Kūinji, a Zen Buddhist temple in Obama, Fukui, is said to be her final resting place.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a fisherman discovered a strange creature when he pulled up his nets. It was the largest fish he had ever caught in all of his years of fishing, and it had a human face. He told everyone he knew about the fabulous and strange fish he had caught, and invited them to dinner to taste it.\n\nDuring the meal, one of his guests snuck off into the kitchen to sneak a peek at this fish which everyone had all heard so much about. The guest recognized that it wasn’t a fish, but a ningyo. It was well known that ningyo flesh bestowed eternal life and youth on whomever ate it. He quietly warned the others what it was. Despite the promise of eternal life, the guests felt strange about eating the flesh of a yōkai, so they only pretended to eat the meat, secretly wrapping it up and hiding it in their sleeves to discard on the way home.\n\nOne of the guests, however, had gotten drunk and forgot to throw away his meat. At home, he absent-mindedly gave the leftovers to his teenage daughter. The next morning, he remembered what he had done and was filled with dread. He was sure that his daughter would be poisoned or cursed for eating yōkai meat. Days passed, but she showed no signs of distress. As she appeared alright, the man never bothered to say anything about the ningyo to his daughter. Soon the matter was forgotten entirely.\n\nMany years passed, but the young girl never seemed to age a day. She got married. Her father grew old and died. Eventually, so did her husband. But no matter how many years passed, the girl remained as youthful and beautiful as she did in her teens. Everybody she cared for grew old and died while she never aged. She became sad and lonely, and eventually she joined a temple and became a nun. She left her hometown to travel the country, planting trees and helping people wherever she went.\n\nAfter hundreds of years, Yaobikuni grew weary of the world. She retired in Wakasa Province, and took up residence in a cave. There she prayed day and night to be free of her curse. She never moved from the cave, and eventually she had sat for so long that she turned into stone. It is said that in one of the caves around Wakasa, there stands a stone that looks just like a beautiful, young woman.\n\n",

It enjoys startling people, but does not cause harm.\n\nOrigin: Torakoishi was invented by Utagawa Yoshikazu in his series depicting the fifty stations of the Tōkaidō. Torakoishi appears playfully jumping at people in the print of Ōiso station. Its name is a pun based on a legendary stone named Toragoishi which was kept at Endaiji Temple in Ōiso, Kanagawa Prefecture. While the actual stone was named for a girl called Tora, Utagawa Yoshikazu used the literal meaning of the name Tora—tiger—to turn it into an animal yōkai.\n\nLegends: In the late 12th century lived a samurai named Yamashita Chōja. Though he was growing old, he had still not been blessed with any children. His wife prayed day and night to Toraike Benzaiten, a local manifestation of the goddess of mercy, for a miracle. One night, Benzaiten appeared to her in a dream. The following morning, she awoke to find a beautiful stone placed next to her. Believing it to be a gift from the goddess, she worshipped the stone day and night. Her prayers were answered, and soon she was blessed with a baby girl. They named her Tora in honor of Toraike Benzaiten, who gave her to them. Yamashita Chōja built a shrine honoring Toraike Benzaiten and housed the stone inside it. And as Tora grew older, the stone likewise grew in size until it was like a small boulder.\n\nTora grew to be a beautiful young woman. She became a renowned dancer and a prostitute, and eventually became a concubine of the warrior Soga Sukenari. One day, Sukenari’s enemy Kudō Suketsune sent an assassin to kill him while he was visiting Yamashita Chōja’s manor. The assassin fired an arrow, but it bounced off of him harmlessly. Then the assassin slashed at him with his sword, but again he could not harm him. Looking closely, the assassin saw that he had struck a large stone. It was Tora’s stone, which had magically disguised itself as Sukenari to save his life. The assassin fled, but the chips in the stone where the arrow and sword struck it remained as proof of its life-saving power.\n\nThe miraculous stone’s tale spread far and wide. It became the village of Ōiso’s famous tourist attraction, and people came from near and far to marvel at the stone. The stone is now enshrined at Endaiji, where it remains a popular attraction for worshippers seeking safe childbirth, protection, and other blessings.\n\n",

Moriyuki’s kind wife let her stay there and give birth. When a footman named Kaketa Wanazō captured and killed the kitsune’s mate, Moriyuki’s wife took pity on the kitsune. She slipped her food to help raise her young. The cubs grew up healthy and left the nest. Then, the kitsune began to plan her revenge on Wanazō.\n\nWanazō was having an affair with Masaki, the nanny of Moriyuki’s infant son Takatsugu. One night, Wanazō and Masaki secretly slipped away from the castle. The kitsune followed them. Once away from the safety of the castle, she transformed into a bandit and threatened Wanazō with a sword. Wanazō and Masaki ran for their lives. They slipped off the road into the river and drowned.\n\nThe kitsune had her revenge, but she felt bad that the young Takatsugu lost his nanny. To repay the kindness Takatsugu’s mother had shown her, she transformed into Masaki and took her place as Takatsugu’s nanny. For two years Masaki the kitsune raised Takatsugu.\n\nOne day, Masaki dozed off and part of her disguise failed. The young Takatsugu was startled. He cried out, “Nanny’s face turned into a dog!” Masaki knew if people learned that Takatsugu had been raised on beast’s milk, it would bring shame on him as a warrior. With tears in her eyes, she fled the castle before anyone could learn of her deception.\n\nMasaki moved to a field in Ueno and contemplated her life. Although she had lived for hundreds of years, she had not lived a meritorious life. Her divine power was low. She had killed people–even though they were her enemies. Masaki dedicated her life to charity and helping others. She disguised herself as an old woman and opened a tea shop. She sheltered travelers from the heat and cold. She gave refuge to orphans. She talked star-crossed lovers out of suicide pacts. She clothed and fed the hopelessly poor. Over twenty years, Masaki saved the lives of 999 people. In that time, she reached her one thousandth birthday. Her tail split into nine strands, and her fur became white. Masaki became clairvoyant, which is how she sensed that Takatsugu was in danger.\n\nMasaki summoned all nearby kitsune. They transformed into warriors and followed Masaki to rescue Takatsugu. After saving him, Masaki revealed her identity. She told him of their past connection and informed him that through her years of hard work and virtue she had earned the favor of the emperor of heaven. She was to transform into a koryū (“fox dragon”)–a kitsune so powerful and virtuous that it is indistinguishable from a dragon–and ascend to heaven, leaving the earthly world behind.\n\nMasaki left the teahouse and dove into Shinobazu Pond. A moment later, clouds formed, and rain began to pour from the sky. As the storm blew, a great white kitsune dragon emerged from the pond. The tea shop and all its tea utensils and furniture were sucked up into the sky. After a few moments, the thunder, wind, and rain subsided, the sky cleared, and Masaki disappeared.\n\n",

It mirrors human society, with families and tribes, ranks, and various levels of awards and degrees. Sources disagree on the exact structure of zenko society. According to one common classification, Zenko are divided into five groups based on fur color: tenko (heavenly foxes), kinko (gold foxes), ginko (silver foxes), byakko (white foxes), and kokuko (black foxes). Another classification divides them into three social ranks with no regard for coloring: tenko (heavenly foxes), kūko (sky foxes), and kiko (spirit foxes). Still other classifications exist. Individual shrines such as the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyōto often have their own degrees and ranks to bestow upon hard-working zenko. The one area where everyone agrees is that zenko stand in stark contrast to yako (wild foxes).\n\nEvil behavior frequently attributed to kitsune is always the work of yako, not zenko. Whereas yako have no interest in advancement in kitsune society, zenko work hard to improve themselves and increase their social standing. Zenko may occasionally play tricks or pranks on people, but they do not seriously harm or kill humans.\n\nZenko serve the gods as messengers, facilitating communications between humans and kami.

Zenko can even be enshrined as gods themselves, or as manifestations or emanations of higher deities.\n\nOrigin: Kitsune monogatari, part of the Edo period essay collection Kyūsensha manpitsu, is a well-known source on the structure of kitsune society. It claims to be the recorded words of a kitsune who possessed a human and discussed the different tribes of zenko and the ranks of kitsune society through its host’s mouth. The kitsune made a very clear point that there was a distinction between benevolent zenko and wicked yako.\n\n",

The red hair, white skin, strange materials, and unknown language suggest that she could have been European, and Kyokutei Bakin believed she might have been a Russian princess—or possibly British, American, or even Bengali. Utsurobune stories share several themes with marebito legends about gods visiting villagers from across the sea, and Yanagita Kunio believed that the accounts were simply fabrications built upon earlier folktales—perhaps remnants an ancient national memory about immigration to Japan. More recently, ufologists have suggested that utsurobune were flying saucers which crash landed in Japan centuries before the idea of UFOs entered the global imagination.\n\nLegends: In 1803, a strange vessel drifted to shore in Hitachi Province. The object was shaped like a circular box about 5.4 meters in diameter and 3.3 meters in height. The upper section was made of wood and transparent glass plates, and sealed with tree resin. The lower section was lined with metal sheets.\n\nVillagers peered inside the glass windows and saw that the inside of the boat was decorated with text written in a strange, unknown language. A few supplies were contained within, including two fancy rugs for a makeshift bed, a jug of water, a brazier, a decorative earthenware dish and teacup, and some cakes and kneaded meat.\n\nA beautiful young woman emerged from the boat. She was about twenty years old, from an unknown foreign country. Her skin was pale and clean, and she stood 1.5 meters tall. She had red eyebrows and long red hair with extensions made of white fur or threads. She wore fine clothing made from unknown fabrics. She carried a plain-looking box, which must have been valuable because she would not put it down and would not let anyone touch it. The woman seemed polite and friendly, but her language was unrecognizable. Nobody could figure out where she came from.\n\nNobody knew what to do with the strange girl. One villager suggested that the woman might be a foreign princess. She may have been exiled for having an extramarital affair. Her lover was executed, but since she was a beloved princess, she was merely exiled to sea. The box she carried probably contained her lover’s head, which is why she guarded it so strongly.\n\nThe villagers worried that if she was indeed an exiled princess, they could be ordered to spend a great deal of money investigating her. They decided the best solution was to return her to sea and leave her to her fate. The strange woman was forced back into her boat and pushed out to sea again.\n\n",

Its most prominent feature and namesake is the long, bright red tongue that lolls from its mouth. Only the shape of its hairy, monstrous face and long, bestial claws are known. The rest of its body is perpetually hidden inside of the dark, black clouds in which it lives.\n\nBehavior: The aka shita appears during the summer months, when rain and water are at their highest demand to ensure a successful growing season. They are agents of retribution, primarily known as punishers in water disputes. Because plenty of water is essential for keeping rice paddies flooded, Japan’s farmlands are interlaced with an intricate series of interconnected aqueducts and canals meant to deliver water to all of the farmers equally. In times of drought, however, a wicked farmer may open up the sluice gates and drain his neighbor’s water into his own field. Such a serious crime can cost a family its livelihood, and water bandits face the violent wrath of their neighbors. Some clever water thieves are never caught, and may think they’ve gotten away with their crime.

They are the ghosts of sailors who died in shipwrecks and never passed on to the next life.\n\nBehavior: Mayoibune appear to sailors who stay on the seas late at night. They begin as phantom sounds—unpleasant cackles which sound like dozens of people, although no people or ships are anywhere to be seen. Next, strange orbs of fire appear on the surface of the water and drift about. Then, an evil wind blows in from the northwest. Finally, a ghostly ship comes into view, sailing against the wind.\n\nInteractions: Sailors who encounter mayoibune are haunted by strange sights and sounds. Those who flee and return to shore usually die shortly afterwards from the mental trauma. Those foolish enough to sail closer to a mayoibune are guaranteed to die in a shipwreck.\n\nOrigin: Mayoibune are a type of funa yūrei from Fukuoka Prefecture. Similar ghost ships can be found all along Japan’s coasts, known by many names such as yūreibune (ghost ship), mōjabune (ship of the dead), and yoiyoibune (“Row! Row!” boat).\n\nThe northwesterly wind which accompanies a mayoibune is called tamakaze. Tamakaze normally only blows over the Sea of Japan in the winter. It is dangerous for fishermen due to the strong gusts and heavy rain it brings. It is also said to carry the souls of the dead. These lost souls wander the sea, never having made it to the world of the dead.\n\nIn the old Japanese lunar calendar, the full moon fell on the 15th night of each month—it was the brightest night and thus good for fishing and hunting. But during the Obon holiday, the dead return from the afterlife to visit the living. Working on the sea was prohibited during these nights; fishermen were told to return home before nightfall to be with their families. Accordiong to superstition, bad things happen to people who break this taboo. Meeting a mayoibune is just one example.\n\nLegends: Long ago, four young men from Hatsu, Fukuoka went out fishing during Obon on the night of the 15th. Normally, fishermen take this day off as a holiday, but these men did not care at all about the taboo. They had the waters all to themselves, and caught a great number of mackerel. But as they fished, severed heads began to float up out of the sea. The heads rolled about, bumping into each other and laughing. The fishermen were terrified. They pulled in their nets and began to hurry home. That’s when they noticed that their entire catch was not mackerel, but straw sandals! The men finally made it home, but could not forget the terror of that night. One by one, they went mad and died.\n\n",

They appear as one-eyed, three-fingered humanoid figures rising out of the mud at night. It is said that the five fingers of the human hand represent three vices and two virtues: anger, greed, ignorance, wisdom, and compassion. The ghostly dorotabō appears with only the three fingers representing the vices. It is a spirit of vengeance and rage—angry at the ignorance and greed that now shame its life’s work.\n\nBehavior: Dorotabō roam the overgrown fields, calling out in a mournful voice, “Give me back my rice field!” They haunt their fields after nightfall, disturbing the new inhabitants of their lands and preventing their sleep. Dorotabō continue haunting until the wasteful owners changes their ways or give up and flee, selling the field to someone who will take proper care of it.\n\nOrigin: Most of Japan’s land is bound up in inhospitable mountain ranges where farming is impossible. The usable land is extremely valuable. Families can save for a lifetime just to buy a small plot of precious farmland, and hope to leave it to their offspring after they die. Of course, children do not always follow their parents’ wishes—a prodigal son who forsakes his father’s hard-earned fields in favor of vices like gambling and drinking will find a dorotabō waiting back home.\n\n",

The sails are often decorated with auspicious kanji or other symbols. Spirits of good luck like the Seven Lucky Gods and auspicious animals are often seen aboard and around takarabune.\n\nOrigin: Takarabune evolved from the concept of harai, or spiritual cleansing—an ancient Japanese belief that spiritually unclean things can be cleansed or disposed of by washing them away down a river. A person’s first dream of the new year was an auspicious one, and a bad dream foretold a bad year. During New Year’s or Setsubun, images of ships were placed under the pillow before sleeping in order to catch bad dreams and keep them from coming true. The following morning the images were gathered and ritually discarded in river, carrying the bad dreams away with them like cargo ships. Over time more imagery was added to the ships, such as treasures, gods, and other symbols of prosperity and longevity, and they evolved into the ships of good fortune known as takarabune.\n\nTakarabune appear at the beginning and again at the end of Toriyama Sekien’s final yōkai book, Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. The yōkai in this book are all described as things he saw in dreams, so the takarabune serves as both a symbolic framework for his book—a vessel to carry the “treasure” contained within the book—and as a good luck charm to protect readers from the strange dreams it describes.\n\nLegends: Long ago an old man named Kamijinjii lived on the island of Niijimamura. One day he was walking along Habushiura Beach when he came across the most beautiful sailboat that he had ever seen. There was no dock anywhere nearby, so he thought it strange that such a ship would be there. Even stranger, there was no crew. The ship was filled to the brim with gold and silver, precious art objects, and other treasures piled up on top of each other.\n\nThere was no way that Kamijinjii could carry everything off of the boat by himself, so he took a single gold and lacquer pot lid from the boat as evidence. Then he rushed back to the village to gather people to help him unload the rest of the treasure from the boat. However, by the time Kamijinjii and the other villagers arrived back at Habushiura beach the takarabune was gone, and there was no sign it had ever been there.\n\n",

It is known as one of the “Seven Wonders of Honjo.”\n\nLegends: Long ago lived a hatamoto (a high-ranking samurai) named Aji no Kyūnosuke. One night at his manor in Honjo, a loud, booming voice was heard heard. It echoed like thunder:\n\n“WAAASH MYYY FOOOOOOT!”\n\nJust then there was a splintering crack, and the ceiling tore open. An enormous foot descended into the mansion. The foot was covered in thick, bristly hair, and it was filthy. The terrified servants scrambled to gather buckets, water, and rags. They washed the foot until it was thoroughly clean. Afterwards, the giant foot ascended up through the roof and disappeared.\n\nThe following night, and every night thereafter, the same thing occurred. A booming voice would demand its foot be washed. A giant foot would crash through the roof. And the dutiful servants would wash it clean.\n\nA few nights of this was all that Aji no Kyūnosuke could take. He ordered his servants not to wash the foot anymore. That night, the foot crashed through the ceiling and demanded to be washed as usual. When it was ignored, it thrashed around violently, destroying vast swaths of the mansion’s roof in the process.\n\nKyūnosuke complained to his friends about the nightly visitor and the destruction it was causing. They were very interested. One of them wanted to witness the event so badly that he offered to swap mansions with Kyūnosuke, and Kyūnosuke quickly agreed. However, after his friend moved in, the giant foot never appeared again.\n\nThere’s no definite conclusion as to what caused this strange occurrence. It’s often blamed on a mischievous tanuki, for they have magical powers and they love playing tricks on people. On the other hand, “washing your feet” is also a Japanese idiom for rehabilitating a criminal. A culprit whose “feet have been washed” can be said to have paid his debt to society. One interpretation of this story might be that Aji no Kyūnosuke was doing something illegal, and this yōkai appeared to punish him.\n\n",

Everything else about them is entirely speculation, added on later by storytellers and folklorists.\n\nAlthough nothing is written about hajikkaki, its illustrations are based on a Chinese spirit called the shahyōchū (謝豹虫).

They are so shy that they spend their entire lives buried under the ground. If you should dig one up, it will bestow a curse of shame on you, and something terribly shameful or embarrassing will happen to you.

They are identical to wild foxes found elsewhere in the world apart from their incredible magical powers. Their cute faces and small size make them particularly loved by most people.\n\nBehavior: There are two major variations of kitsune. Holy foxes are servants of the Shinto deity Inari, and Inari’s shrines are decorated with statues and images of these foxes. Legends tell of celestial foxes providing wisdom or service to good and pious humans. These holy foxes act as messengers of the gods and mediums between the celestial and human worlds. They often protect humans or places, provide good luck, and ward evil spirits away. More common are the wild foxes which delight in mischief, pranks, or evil. There are stories in which wild foxes trick or even possess humans, and cause them to behave strangely. Despite this wicked nature, even wild foxes keep their promises, remember friendships, and repay any favors done for them.\n\nInteractions: Most tales of kitsune are about wild foxes punishing wicked priests, greedy merchants, and boastful drunkards. They vex their targets by creating phantom sounds and sights, stealing from them, or otherwise humiliating them publicly. Certain mental disorders have been attributed to possession by kitsune (known as kitsunetsuki). Mysterious illusory fires and strange lights in the sky are said to be caused by their magic, and are known as kitsunebi, or “fox fire.”\n\nOther forms: Kitsune are extremely intelligent and powerful shape-shifters. They frequently harass humans by transforming into giants or other fearsome monsters. Sometimes they do this just for pranks, and sometimes for more nefarious purposes. They are skilled enough to even transform into exact likenesses of individual people, often appearing in the guise of beautiful human women in order to trick young men. On more than one occasion, this has resulted in a marriage with an unwitting human. Some kitsune even spend most of their lives in human form, adopting human names and customs, taking human jobs, and even raising families. When startled, or drunk, or careless, a patch of their magical disguise can fail—the kitsune’s true nature may be revealed by a tail, a swatch of fur, fangs, or some other vulpine feature.\n\n",

She hides herself away in the back of the temple and feeds off of human corpses.\n\nBehavior: A kokuri babā was once a priest’s widow at a remote, rural temple. While her husband lived, she was a dutiful wife, helping run the temple, tending to the needs of the parishioners, cooking, cleaning, washing, and taking care of the temple grounds. However, after her husband’s death, she retreated into the temple’s living quarters and became a shut in. When her food stores ran out, she began to steal the offerings left behind by people visiting the temple. Because of this grave sin, she transformed into a yokai, unable to pass on to the next life. From then on, she developed a taste for human flesh. She survived by carving up meat from the corpses of the recently dead. When there were no fresh corpses available, she would unearth previously buried corpses and peel off chunks of their rotting skin off to gnaw on.\n\nInteractions: Kokuri babā do not usually interact with people, preferring to stay hidden away in the back rooms of their temples. However, when traveling monks pay a visit to their temple, they do not pass up the chance for some fresh meat. People who encounter a kokuri babā usually realize too late that they are in danger.\n\nOrigin: Kokuri babā was invented by Toriyama Sekien for his book Konjaku hyakki shūi. Although it is written with words that literally mean “hag of the old temple living quarters,” Sekien was well known for using wordplay in his yōkai names, and this yōkai was no exception.\n\nKokuri is reminiscent of a popular folk phrase “Mukuri kokuri,” which is used as a metaphor for something scary. Indeed, Sekien points out in his description that kokuri babā is even more fearsome than Datsueba, the skin-flaying hag of the underworld. Parents would scold misbehaving children with, “Mukuri kokuri, a demon will come (if you don’t stop misbehaving)!”\n\nMukuri kokuri has a long history, originating in the the Mongol invasions of the 13th century. The Mongols under Kublai Khan had conquered China and Korea, and they had set their sights on Japan. The invaders were viewed by most people as the living embodiment of demons. Japan’s victory against the Mongols—thanks in no small part to two typhoons (believed to be kamikaze, or “divine winds” sent from the gods) which eradicated the two major Mongol invasion fleets—ended Mongol expansion and is had a profound impact on the identity of Japan as a nation. The memory of the invasions remained strong for generations, and became a part of folklore. The fear of invading Mongols was the basis for the phrase “Mōko Kōkuri no oni ga kuru” (“The Mongolian-Korean demons are coming!”), which over the centuries was corrupted down to just mukuri kokuri.\n\n",

He has dresses in the robes of an ancient government official from the Chinese Tang Dynasty, and wears a fearsome expression upon his face. He is served by two secretaries, Shiroku and Shimyō, as well as a number of other demonic servants—the chiefs of which are Gozu and Mezu. His name often is invoked by parents who scold their children, “If you tell a lie, Enma will rip out your tongue!”\n\nBehavior: Enma’s chief duty is to judge the souls of the newly dead and send them on to their next location. He keeps a great scroll in which he records all of the good and evil deeds of each and every person to use as evidence against them when their time of judgment comes. He oversees the torturing and suffering in hell, making sure that each soul gets enough punishment.\n\nOrigin: Like many demonic figures in Japanese folklore, Great King Enma has a honji, or “true form,” which is that of a Buddha or bodhisattva. Enma’s true form is Jizō Bosatsu, the guardian of the underworld, god of travelers, and protector of children. Jizō is a warm and compassionate, beloved across Japan, deity who made a solemn vow not to become a full Buddha until all souls have been freed from suffering in hell. It is not uncommon to see small, red-bibbed, stone Jizō statues along roads and paths, and in graveyards all over Japan. While Enma may seem fearsome and terrifying, at heart, he is a kind and compassionate god, and he truly wishes to save each soul from damnation—this may be why the souls of the dead are given so many tests and trials to avoid going to hell.\n\nEnma’s origins lie in India. In Vedic mythology he is known as Yama, the god of death. From the Vedas, the idea of Yama spread into Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. Buddhism traveled to China, bringing Yama with it, and mixed with local religions and superstitions before being brought to Japan during the Tang Dynasty. As Chinese Buddhism mixed with Japanese religions and superstitions, he gradually developed into the god known as Great King Enma.\n\n",

When hizō no mushi grasps the muscles in its talons, the victim’s body becomes hot and he begins to feel dizzy as if hit on the head.\n\nA hizō no mushi infection can be cured by taking Chinese medicine made from mokkō (a species of thistle) and daiō (a kind of rheum).\n\n",

Specifically the term refers to low ranking, wild kitsune that do not have a divine soul or serve as messengers of the gods. They are particularly known for transforming into humans. In folktales where humans are tormented, tricked, or possessed by kitsune, the culprit is almost always a nogitsune.\n\nBehavior: Nogitsune are cautious creatures with a keen danger sense. They dislike bright light, and hide from the sun during the daytime. They are also afraid of bladed objects, and will avoid swords and knives. They are frightened of dogs as well. A nogitsune disguised as a human might accidentally reveal their true form when startled by a barking dog.\n\nNogitsune are able to recognize signs of human activity. They generally hide from humans when possible. However, they like to sneak into human-inhabited areas at night to steal some of their favorite foods: wax candles, lamp oil, lacquer, alcohol, and fried tofu.\n\nSome types kitsune are viewed as holy animals; nogitsune are not one of these types. They are low-ranking members of the kitsune family, and do not act as divine messengers or serve Inari. Despite this, they seem to be comfortable in their position and don’t aspire to increase their standing.\n\nInteractions: Nogitsune are notorious tricksters. One of their favorite activities is transforming in order to trick foolish humans. They use their power to scare people, and often to steal things from them as well. In order to change its shape, a nogitsune requires a magical focus of some kind; usually a bone from a cow or a horse.\n\nKitsunetsuki—possession by a fox spirit—is also commonly performed by nogitsune. Sometimes it is to punish humans they don’t like, other times it is just for the nogitsune’s own amusement. Women are a favorite target. This is sometimes said to be because women are weaker and easier to possess, but it is also because nogitsune can feed off of a woman’s life force.\n\nDespite these conflicts with humans, nogitsune do occasionally interact positively with people. There are many tales of wild kitsune returning favors to those who are kind to them. There are even stories about men happily marrying nogitsune disguised as beautiful women. Unfortunately these stories almost always end in tragedy when the disguise is discovered. Humans occasionally ask nogitsune for favors. However, nogitsune are notoriously unreliable. If you ask a one to protect an object, it will only do so for a short time before it forgets its promise and wanders off.\n\nOrigin: Nogitsune are known by many different names. The most common one—yako—is simply another reading of the kanji in its name. The name yakan (野干) is more archaic, and has its origins in a different animal.\n\nYakan are magical beasts from Chinese Buddhist scripture. The term literally means “wild dogs,” and their description can be found in various scriptures. They are small and cunning. They are yellow in color, and resemble small dogs with fluffy tails. They can change their shape, so their true form is unknown. They live in packs, and cry out at night like wolves. In the original Sanskrit, the animal referred to is the jackal. Jackals linger around burial grounds and eat carrion, and so they were viewed as wicked animals and servitors of evil gods. When Buddhism was transmitted to China, because jackals do not exist in China, the animal was not understood. They were assumed to be a creature similar to foxes, martens, or wild dogs. When Buddhism was brought to Japan, yakan was assumed to be a fox, and became synonymous with kitsune. Thus, the wicked deeds performed by jackals in Indian folklore came to be associated with foxes in Japanese folklore.\n\n",

His home is in Sōjōgatani—”the valley of the high priest”—located deep within the interior of the mountain. He has long, white hair, an incredibly long nose, and possesses the strength of one thousand tengu. Sōjōbō is first in rank among the tengu, and is often referred to as their king.\n\nOrigin: Sōjōbō is known through his connection to Kurama Temple, an isolated temple which practices a unique branch of esoteric Buddhism. Kurama Temple has long had a connection with yamabushi and ascetic mountain religions, and the tengu which these religions worship. Because Sōjōbō resides there, Mount Kurama is also considered to be the most important mountain to tengu. According to Kurama Temple, Sōjōbō is either one rank below Maō-son—one third of the holy trinity which is central to the Kurama faith—or is in fact another form of Mao-son.\n\nLegends: Not much is written about Sōjōbō, although his name is well known. The most famous legend about Sōjōbō is that he trained a young boy named Ushiwakamaru. As the king of the tengu, Sōjōbō possesses a knowledge of magic, military tactics, and swordsmanship unsurpassed by any other. The young Ushiwakamaru wished to learn from him, and traveled deep into Sōjōgatani to undergo a long and arduous training. This was a very dangerous quest, as tengu are fierce and unpredictable, and Sōjōbō was rumored to eat children who wandered too deep into the forest. However, Sōjōbō was impressed with the young boy’s bravery and agreed to train him.\n\nUshiwakamaru grew up to become Minamoto Yoshitsune, who lived from 1159-1189 CE. Yoshitsune remains of Japan’s most celebrated warriors, and is one of the main heroes in the Tale of the Heike. His umatched swordsmanship is credited to the training he received from the tengu of Mount Kurama.\n\n",

She sometimes appears in the form of a large serpent riding a cloud and wearing a small golden snake like a crown. At other times, she is depicted as a female or male human wearing ancient Chinese imperial clothing.\n\nBehavior: Zennyo is the daughter of Shagara Ryūō, one of the eight great dragon kings. She is wise, clever, and aware of the deeds of all sentient beings in the universe. She is eloquent, virtuous, compassionate, and merciful. At a very young age, she understood all of the teachings of the Buddha and became enlightened.\n\nInteractions: Zennyo is worshiped at several shrines and temples, including Shinsenen and Kongōbuji on Mount Kōya in Wakayama. Both institutions are connected to Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism and a highly influential monk who was the first to worship Zennyo in Japan. At Daigōji in Kyōto she is worshipped as Seiryū Gongen.\n\nOrigin: Zennyō is described in the Lotus Sutra as the eight-year-old daughter of Shagara. During a discussion about how anyone who practices the Lotus Sutra can become a buddha in a single lifetime, she is presented as an example of one such being. Her diligent study of the sutra allowed her to instantly achieve buddhahood. This claim was met with skepticism by many. It was believed that women were unclean and impure, and thus could never attain enlightenment. On top of that, Shakyamuni was only able to attain that stage after a long period of difficult, incessant religious practice; surely a young girl could not reach enlightenment at all, let alone faster than the Buddha himself. But Zennyō proved them wrong by changing herself into a man, perfecting all of the spiritual practices, preaching the dharma, and instantly attaining enlightenment before their eyes. As they witnessed her become a buddha, the onlookers rejoiced, and understood that salvation was attainable by anyone.\n\nLegends: The most famous story about Zennyō Ryūō is recorded and expanded upon in several histories, such as Konjaku monogatarishū and Taiheiki.\n\nIn 824 CE, during the reign of Emperor Junna, there was a great drought. The emperor asked the rival abbots Shubin of Saiji Temple and Kūkai of Tōji Temple to pray for an end to the drought. Shubin went first. He prayed and performed rituals for seven days, but only a few drops of water fell, and only over the capital. Next, Kūkai went. He performed the Shō’u kyōhō rainmaking ritual for one week, but not a single drop of rain fell.\n\nKūkai thought this was strange, so he investigated. He discovered that Shubin had grown jealous of Kūkai’s fame and had used a magical spell to capture all of the dragon gods in a water bottle. Shubin was responsible for the drought. However, one dragon god was a bodhisattva, and thus too powerful to be captured by Shubin’s magic: Zennyō, who lived in a lake in northern India.\n\nKūkai continued praying for two more days, this time to Zennyo Ryūō. A 2.7 meter long serpent wearing a 24 centimeter long golden snake as a crown appeared and slithered into the pond at Shinsenen. Suddenly the sky grew dark and rain began to fall. It continued for three days and nights, raining all across Japan. The drought was over.\n\n",

Nojukubi is a mysterious fire which ignites and extinguishes on its own. It appears most often in the spring just after the season of cherry blossom viewing parties, or in the fall after the season of fall foliage viewing parties. It is most commonly found on roadsides or in the mountains, along routes where people go on excursions or hikes. It takes the form of a thin streak of flame which appears out of nowhere.\n\nBehavior: Nojukubi is most commonly found in wilderness areas from which humans have recently left. These bizarre fires flare up suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, and just as quickly extinguish for no reason, even when they appear to be burning strong. They reignite and extinguish themselves over and over.\n\nNojukubi exhibits a number of strange qualities which distinguish it from ordinary campfires. It appears more frequently just after it stops raining, unhindered by the dampness. It does not give off any heat. It does not consume wood or kindling as it burns, and it does not spread like a normal fire does. Perhaps strangest of all, witnesses of nojukubi report that human voices can be heard having conversations or reciting poetry and songs from within the flames—remnants of the lively activity which took place earlier.\n\nOrigin: Nojukubi appears in the Edo Period yokai collection Ehon hyakumonogatari, where it is noted as being a phenomenon separate from kitsunebi or Sōgenbi.

All souls must pass by them before moving on to Meido to be judged.\n\nINTERACTION: During a Japanese funeral, 6 mon (an old form of currency) are placed in the coffin to be used as a toll to enter the underworld. Upon reaching the Sanzu River, the souls must cross either by bridge (if they were good in life), by wading in the shallows (if they were only somewhat good), or by swimming across the deepest part of the river (if they were wicked).\n\nAfter crossing the river, each soul encounters Datsueba, who accepts the toll and strips the souls of the clothes on their backs. Datsueba hands the clothing to her partner, Keneō, who hangs it from a tree by the riverside. The amount that the branch bends under the weight of the clothes serves as a measure of the weight of the sin each soul carries, and is used as evidence in the trials to come. Of course, the clothes of those who had to ford the river or swim across are heavy and wet, which only makes the branches of the tree sag lower. If a soul arrives with no clothes, Keneō flays his or her skin and hangs it from the tree instead.\n\nDatsueba and Keneō perform a little bit of torture themselves, breaking the fingers of those guilty of theft, and so on. They also roam the banks of the river, tormenting the souls of children who are too young to cross the river and must wait for salvation to come to them instead.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Datsueba is the wife of King Enma. In the Edo period, she became a popular object of folk worship, and temples dedicated to her began to spring up around Japan. Prayers and charms dedicated to Datsueba were used as wards against disease and coughs, in particular for children’s coughs.\n\n",

The demands and hardships of such a life were too much for most to bear. Work hours were long and difficult, pay was low, and abuse was commonplace, both from clients and employers.

Without intervention, he will eventually die, joining his lover forever in death’s embrace.\n\nIn most cases, a friend or a servant of her lover will see through the hone onna’s illusion and alert someone to her true identity. Though her human lover may be repulsed by her when the truth is revealed to him, the ghost may not realizes her condition and continue to visit every night. A home can be warded with prayers and magic charms against entry by ghosts, but they only work as long as the master of the house wills them to. As the hone onna’s body decays further, her enchanting allure only increases. Eventually most men succumb and let her into their homes one last time, sacrificing their own lives to the ghost of the woman they loved.\n\nLegends: Perhaps the most famous hone onna is Otsuyu from Botan dōrō, or The Tale of the Peony Lantern. Botan dōrō was introduced to Japan in the 17th century from an old Chinese ghost story. Over the centuries, it has been adapted into puppet shows, kabuki plays, rakugo, and films, and remains an influential ghost story today.\n\n",

Her name comes from the deep, bloody gash which runs across her face, grinning from ear to ear. She appears at night to lone travelers on the road, covering her grizzly mouth with a cloth mask, a fan, or a handkerchief.\n\nInteractions: Kuchisake onna sneaks up on her victims in the dark and asks them if they think she is beautiful: “Watashi, kirei?” If the victim answers yes, she pulls off her mask and reveals a red, blood-dripping, grotesque mouth. Then she asks in a grisly voice if they still think she is beautiful: “Kore demo?” If her victim answers no or screams in terror, she slashes him from ear to ear in an imitation of her own mutilation. If he lies and answers yes a second time, she walks away—only to follow her target home and slaughter him brutally that night.\n\nOrigin: The spirits of the dead who were killed in particularly violent manners—abused wives, tortured captives, defeated enemies—often do not rest well. The kuchisake onna is thought to be one such woman. However, during the Edo period, a large number of kuchisake onna attacks were blamed on shape-changed kitsune playing pranks on young men. During the 20th century, the blame began to be placed on ghosts, serial killers, and simple mass hysteria. This resulted in an explosion of kuchisake onna sightings over Japan. Over the years, clever young people claim to have outsmarted kuchisake onna by delivering quick, confusing answers, or by throwing money or hard candy at them. This buys enough time to escape from the kuchisake onna’s wrath and lose her in the darkness.\n\n",

She is a kind of tsukumogami—an artifact spirit—which manifests out of old-fashioned book carts called fuguruma. In particular, it is the emotion and attachment built up in the piles of love letters stored in these carts which gives birth to this yōkai.\n\nOrigin: Fuguruma yōhi appears alongside chirizuka kaiō in Toriyama Sekien’s collection of tsukumogami Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Like chirizuka kaiō, her name is a pun based on essay 72 from the medieval essay collection Tsurezure gusa. The essay discusses the folly of overabundance. Having too many possessions is a bad thing which distracts you from that which is important; however there is no such thing as having too many books on your book cart. The fuguruma yōhi is what Toriyama Sekien imagined might appear if you actually did have too many books on  your book cart. The desire and attachment written in each single love letter may not amount to very much, but if there are enough letters, enough attachments may pile up that a yōkai can be born from them.\n\n",

            "content": "冥途\nめいどTranslation: dark way; the underworld\n\nAppearance: When someone dies, they either go to Tengoku (heaven) or Jigoku (hell). If they lived an exceptionally good or an exceptionally evil life, they may go straight to Tengoku or Jigoku. However, for most people—who have done both and good and evil in their lives—the soul travels to Meido. There they face a test by the judges of the dead, each of whose true form is that of a buddha or a god. They are then sent either to Tengoku or Jigoku. Meido is a terrible place—though nowhere near as terrible as Jigoku. It is dark, windy, and full of horrible sights, sounds, tests and trials. It is a long journey, with no place to rest or find comfort.\n\nTo enter the underworld, the soul much first find and cross the Sanzu River, the River of Three Crossings, which marks the boundary between this world and the world of the dead. The Sanzu River is said to be located somewhere on Mount Osore, literally Mount Fear, a desolate volcano located in northern Japan. Despite its appearance—covered in blasted rocks, bubbling pits of dark liquid, and open vents spewing out toxic gas—Mount Osore is one of the three holiest places in Japan. Itako, blind shamanesses, communicate with the dead as they approach the mountain.\n\nInteractions: There are many variations on what exactly happens after this life ends. These are often depicted in graphic hell scrolls kept at temples. The depictions differ greatly from tradition to tradition and place to place. A typical explanation may go like this:\n\nUpon dying, souls are visited by three oni who escort them on a seven day journey to Meido. The journey is harsh and terrible. It is dark, and a strong, howling wind rages constantly. The corruption of the living world materializes into swords on this plane, which pierce the bodies of the travelers, turning the surrounding terrain into a sea of blood.\n\nA few days along the way, the souls are assaulted by horrible birds, which tear at their skin and pluck out their eyes. All the while the birds taunt them and scream at them to hurry up. “Why didn’t you tell me sooner? I would have hurried from the start!” cry the souls of the dead. “What is this stupid soul saying!” cry the birds. “We were perched on his roof since three days before he died, warning him to start saying his prayers! That fool only said, ‘The crows are being extra noisy today. The old woman next door must be dying. Go bring her some sugar.’ Well the old woman is still alive, happily licking her sugar!”\n\nNext, the souls come to an enormous mountain which scrapes the clouds, covered in sharp thorns. The path up the mountain is steep and impossibly long. The souls cry out, “I was sick and weak in life, how can you expect me to climb such a mountain now?” To which the oni reply, “What is this stupid soul saying! This is the mountain of your greed! Every time you wanted something your neighbor owned, or desired some earthly possession, you added to this mountain! You built it, now you can climb it!” Anyone who lags behind gets hit with the oni’s terrible iron club.\n\nFinally, after seven days, the souls arrive at the Sanzu River and face the first trial put forth by the first judge, King Shinkō (whose true form is that of Fudō Myōō; who is known as Acala in English). Shinkō judges the souls on how much killing they have committed, down to every bug that was squashed and every fish that was caught. Those whom Shinkō judges to be wicked go straight to Jigoku. Others may cross the river depending on how well they fared in the trial. To cross the Sanzu River, a toll of 6 mon (an old form of currency) is required. This is buried with the deceased during the funeral. Those whose funerals were not properly performed and did not receive the 6 mon cannot cross. This is the reason that the seventh day after death is an important day in Japanese funerary services. The services and prayers performed for the deceased aid them in this trial and allow them to cross the river.\n\nOne part of the Sanzu River is crossed by a great bridge. Another part of the river is shallow and fordable. The rest of the river is wild and deep, and filled with poisonous snakes. The souls with the most good deeds are allowed to cross the bridge. Those with a mixture of both good and evil may ford the river in the shallow part. The worst of the souls may only cross by swimming through snake-filled rapids. The crossing of the Sanzu River takes seven days.\n\nAfter crossing the river, the souls encounter Datsueba and Keneō. These two oni take the heavy clothes from each soul, wet from the crossing of the river, and hang them on a tree. The amount the branch bends under the weight of the clothes serves as a measure of the weight of the sin on each soul, to be used as evidence in the trials to come. If a soul arrives with no clothes—perhaps having discarded them while swimming in the river—Datsueba flays his or her skin and hangs it from the tree instead.\n\nThe second trial takes place fourteen days after death, and is overseen by King Shokō (whose true form is Shaka Nyōrai, or Siddhartha Gautama). Shokō judges the souls on how much they have stolen. As with the previous trial, he sends the most grievous offenders straight to hell, while allowing the good to pass on to the next trial. Again, the fourteenth day after death is an important day for family members to perform ceremonies in honor of the deceased, in order to help him or her pass this trial.\n\nBefore the third trial, each soul must pass through a fortified gate which is guarded by a fierce oni. The oni wields large blades, which he uses to haphazardly chop off the arms and legs of the souls, saying, “That hand helped you to sin. I’ll cut if off for you!” The souls must then cross an enormous bay, wider than the Sanzu River, and filled with boiling liquid. The river gives off foul smelling fumes in all directions for many miles.\n\nThe third trial takes place 21 days after death, and is overseen by King Sōtei (whose true form is Manji Bosatsu, or Manjusri). Sōtei judges the souls on their sins of lust and sexuality, using a cat and a snake. The cat judges the souls of men; it bites at their penises, and the degree of the injury—from a slight scratch to completely severed—is used as a measure of one’s sexual sin. The snake judges the souls of women; it is inserted into the woman, and the depth to which it can enter is used to determine the depth of her sin. As before, some will go on to hell, while others—with the aid of funerary services from their surviving family members—will pass on to the next trial.\n\nThe fourth trial, 28 days after death, is overseen by King Gokan (whose true form is Fugen Bosatsu, or Samantabhadra). Gokan judges the dead on the number of lies they told in life. He weighs each soul against a large, heavy stone. The number of stones it takes the balance the scale determines the weight of one’s sins. Excessive liars are damned—those who are not may continue on to be judged again. Once again, the family holds a funerary service to aid their beloved departed in this trial, hoping to sway the mercy of the judge.\n\nNext, the souls must cross a vast blasted, desolate landscape of unfathomable length. Balls of red-hot iron fall constantly like rain from the sky, burning the skin of the souls and causing their feet to blister as they walk the path to the next trial.\n\nThe fifth trial, 35 days after death, is overseen by Great King Enma, the ruler of the underworld (whose true form is that of Jizō Bosatsu, or Ksitigarbha). Enma’s judgment is the final chance to appeal one’s fate through the prayers and memorial services performed by the living relatives. Enma shows each soul a large mirror, in which the individual’s former life is reflected back at them, with all of their sins and transgressions clearly laid out. Enma’s job is to decide, based on his and the previous trials, which of the six Buddhist realms each soul will be reborn into: the realm of heaven, the realm of humans, the realm of ashura, the realm of beasts, the realm of gaki (or hungry ghosts), or the realm of hell.\n\nAfter 42 days, the souls which have made it this far now face the judgment of King Henjō (whose true form is Miroku Bosatsu, or Maitreya). Henjō decides the location of each soul’s rebirth based on the reports from Enma’s mirror and Gokan’s scale.\n\nNext, the souls must cross a dark land, full of strange animals whose cries pierce the darkness and fill the atmosphere with dread. Strange birds attack the souls, breathing flames at them and piercing them with their sharp beaks.\n\nOn the 49th day after death, the souls reach the trial of King Taizan (whose true form is Yakushi Nyōrai, or Bhaisajyaguru). The 49th day memorial service is an important one, with many family members attending to pray for the deceased; Taizan’s trial is the final chance to avoid going to hell. He uses the information from the previous judges to determine the remaining conditions of each soul’s rebirth.\n\nUpon completion of this trial, each soul moves on to a road with six unmarked torii gates, each representing one of the Buddhist realms. There is no way to tell which gate leads to which realm, and each soul must decide for him or herself which gate to choose. Upon passing through the gate, the soul travels along an enormous frozen river, and leaves Meido for the next world, whichever one it may be. For many, the journey ends here. Those who have been judged worthy may find themselves in Tengoku. Others are reborn as humans, animals, or worse. For those deemed unworthy for even the lowest forms of rebirth, more trials await in the realm of Jigoku.\n\nOrigin: The origins of Meido are strongly rooted in Chinese Buddhism. When Buddhism was brought from India to China it took on a structure of its own, merging many aspects with Chinese philosophy and Taoism. This mixture of Chinese Taoism and Indian Buddhism was imported to Japan, after which it began to develop its own uniquely Japanese features as well.\n\n",

He was a member of Shuten dōji’s clan, and is said to be Shuten dōji’s son. He is known for his attempts to take revenge upon the samurai who defeated his father.\n\nLegends: Kidōmaru’s was born after the legendary samurai Minamoto no Yorimitsu (also known as Raikō) and his party of heroes had subjugated Shuten dōji and freed all of the women captured by his oni gang. The women were grateful to the samurai for rescuing them, and returned home to their villages. One of the women, however, didn’t return to her home. Instead, she traveled to the village of Kumohara, where she gave birth to a baby oni—Shuten dōji’s son!\n\nThe boy was named Kidōmaru. He was born with a full set of teeth, and an oni’s strength. By the time he was 7 or 8 years old, he could slay a deer or a boar by throwing a single rock at it. He was apprenticed as a temple servant to Mt. Hiei, just like his father was. And just like his father, he was eventually expelled from the temple for being a wicked, wretched little boy. He fled into the mountains and lived in a cave, turning to robbing people to survive. He studied magic and honed his powers in his secret hideout.\n\nMany years later, Raikō was visiting his younger brother Yorinobu. Yorinobu had captured the oni bandit Kidōmaru and locked him in his bathroom. Raikō scolded his brother for being so careless and not properly subduing the oni with ropes and chains. Raikō showed Yorinobu how to tie up an oni, and made sure Kidōmaru couldn’t escape. Then Raikō spent the night just to make sure nothing bad would happen.\n\nThat night, Kidōmaru easily broke the bonds that were holding him. He wanted revenge, so he snuck up to Raikō’s room and spied on him. Raikō noticed the oni spying on him and decided to lay a trap. In a loud voice he told his attendants that the following morning they would ride to Mount Kurama to make a pilgrimage. Hearing this, Kidōmaru ran ahead to Kurama to plan an ambush for Raikō. On the road outside of Ichiharano, Kidōmaru slaughtered a cow and climbed inside of its body to hide and wait.\n\nWhen Raikō and his companions arrived at Ichiharano, they easily saw through Kidōmaru’s disguise. Raikō’s best archer, Watanabe no Tsuna, shot an arrow through the cow’s body, injuring the oni. Kidōmaru emerged from the cow’s corpse and charged at Raikō with all of his might. However, Raikō was too fast: he cut Kidōmaru down with a single stroke of his blade.\n\n",

Futakuchi onna appear as regular women until their terrible secret is revealed: in the back of their skulls—buried beneath long, thick hair—is a second mouth, full of teeth and with large, fat lips. This second mouth is ravenous, and uses long strands of its hair-like tentacles to gorge itself on any food it can find.\n\nOrigin: In the folk tales of Japan’s eastern regions, futakuchi onna are most often thought to be shape-changed yama uba posing as young women. In the western regions they are frequently shape-changed kumo, or magical spiders. In the other tales they are the result of curses brought about by wicked deeds, similar to rokuro kubi. In each story, regardless of its true nature, this yōkai is used as a punishment upon a greedy man or woman for wickedness and extreme parsimony.\n\nLegends: One story tells of how in a small rural village in Fukushima there lived a stingy miser. Because he could not bear the thought of paying for food to support a family, the miser lived entirely by himself. One day he met a woman who did not eat anything at all, and he immediately took her for his wife. The miser was thrilled with her because she never ate a thing and was still a hard worker. However, his stores of rice steadily decreased, and he could not figure why, for he never saw his wife eat.\n\nOne day, the miser pretended to leave for work. In truth he stayed behind to spy on his new wife. As the miser watched from a hidden location, his wife untied her hair, and revealed a second mouth on the back of her head, complete with ghastly lips and teeth. Her hair reached out with tentacle-like stalks and began to scoop rice balls into the second mouth, which cooed out with pleasure in a vulgar, raspy voice.\n\nThe miser was horrified and resolved to divorce his wife as soon as possible. However, she learned of his plan before he could act on it, and trapped him in a bathtub and carried him off into the mountains. The miser managed to escape. He hid in a heavily scented lily marsh where the futakuchi onna could not find him.\n\nAnother story tells of a wicked stepmother who always gave plenty of food to her own daughter, but never enough to her stepdaughter. Gradually the stepdaughter grew sicker and sicker, until she starved to death. Forty-nine days later, the wicked stepmother was afflicted with a terrible headache. The back of her head split open, and lips, teeth, and a tongue formed. This new mouth ached with debilitating pain until it was fed, and it shrieked in the voice of the dead stepdaughter. From then on the stepmother always had to feed both of her mouths, and always felt the hunger pangs of the stepdaughter she murdered.\n\n",

They are similar in most respects, except that a nukekubi’s head detaches itself completely from its body rather than elongating like a rokurokubi’s neck. Because their heads detach, they can travel further distances than the rokurokubi.\n\nBehavior: Nukekubi possess a thirst for blood, and are more violent than rokurokubi. Their flying head sucks the blood of victims like a vampire. Nukekubi also brutally bite humans and animals to death.\n\nOrigin: Like the rokurokubi, being a nukekubi is considered a curse. Edo period scientists believed that nukekubi suffered from an infliction similar to somnambulism; only instead of walking about at night the patient’s entire soul and head depart from the body. Uncured, this curse has the potential to tear a family apart, particularly due to its violent nature. Treatments for the curse of the rokurokubi and nukekubi have been long sought after—particularly because these women can often pass their curse on to their daughters who shows signs as they mature. Afflicted girls were sold off to live in brothels or human circuses, or forced to commit suicide in order to preserve their families’ honor.\n\nLegends: A famous account from Echizen Province (Fukui Prefecture) tells of a young woman afflicted with the curse of the nukekubi. Her head flew about the capital city at night, chasing young men through the streets all the way back to their houses. Locked out, the head would scratch and bite their doors and gates during the night and leave deep gashes in the wood. When the young girl eventually discovered her curse, she was so ashamed that she asked her husband for a divorce. She ritually cut off all of her hair in repentance and committed suicide. She believed it was better to die than to live the rest of her life as a monster.\n\nAccording to lore from Hitachi, a man married to a nukekubi heard from a peddler that the liver of a white-haired dog could remove the curse. He had such a dog, and killed it and fed its liver to his wife. Sure enough she was cured of the affliction. However, her curse was still passed on to her daughter, whose flying head took to biting white dogs to death. Other accounts claim that by removing the sleeping body to a safe place during the night, the head will not be able return, and will eventually die—however this is not a cure that most families are willing to try.\n\n",

They often wear dilapidated old straw hats and coats, and carry a flaming torch in their mouths. They appear in the winter and creep into villages to steal raincoats, winnowing baskets and eyes from people.\n\nBehavior: Like many one-eyed yōkai, mikari baba are afraid of objects that have many holes in them. This includes things like bamboo sieves and woven cages. It is thought that the holes resemble many eyes, so the mikari baba with its single eye is afraid of them.\n\nMikari baba are one of the few yōkai which are known to work together with other yōkai. They often appear together with the small one-eyed yōkai hitotsume kozō. The two of them travel from house to house during the winter, writing the names of families in a ledger which they present to the gods a few weeks later. The gods then use this report to mete out sickness and misfortune to people as they see fit.\n\nInteractions: Mikari baba go from house to house like beggars, asking to borrow a coat, or a winnowing basket, or even just a few grains of rice. They are so greedy that they will scour gardens for every single last grain of rice. In doing so they put their faces so close to the ground that the torch they carry in their mouth can ignite fires. They will even try to “borrow” an eye from a person’s head.\n\nIn Chiba, Kanagawa, Tōkyō and other places where mikari baba are said to appear, villagers stay at home and remain quiet on these days. Loud voices, lighting lamps, hairdressing, and bathing are avoided. Leaving the house after dark and entering the mountains are forbidden. Measures are taken to discourage mikari baba from approaching the house. Bamboo baskets, sieves, and other woven objects with many “eyes” in them are hung outside of houses or placed on tall bamboo poles throughout villages in order to scare mikari baba away. Fallen grains of rice on the floor and in the gardens are gathered and made into a dango, which is then placed in the doorway to show that there is no rice left to pick up. If even a single grain of rice is left on the ground, it will attract a greedy mikari baba.\n\nMikari baba only appear on fixed dates during the year. The dates vary from tradition to tradition, but usually fall on the eighth day of the second or twelfth month of the lunisolar calendar. These dates are rooted in ancient religious practices surrounding new year rituals, and are referred to as kotoyōka–”eighth day events”–although most places have their own name for these special dates.\n\nOrigin: While the kanji in mikari baba’s name literally mean “winnowing basket borrowing hag,” this is likely a folk etymology that was invented long after she was named. The word mikari has an older meaning, referring to a period of fasting or purification before ancient religious ceremonies. It was believed that bakemono were more likely to appear before religious festivals. People stayed at home and refrained from work and normal activities prior to festivals. This period of quiet isolation was called mikari or mikawari (“changing one’s self”), referring to the interruption of regular daily life in preparation for religious festivities. Because it was forbidden for people to be outside during the mikari period, any person coming to your house was sure to be a yōkai. Mikari baba was the name given to one of these yōkai, and the kanji for her name were added later to reflect her behavior.\n\n",

She knocks on doors and calls out, “Might you have any amazake?” Those who answer her, whether the answer is yes or no, fall terribly ill. A cedar branch hung over the door is said to keep the amazake babā from approaching your house.\n\nA variation of amazake babā from Yamanashi prefecture is called amazake banbā. She travels from house to house trying to sell sake and amazake. The consequences of replying to her are the same as with amazake babā, but the way to keep her at bay is slightly different. If you hang a sign at the front door that says “we do not like sake or amazake,” she will leave you alone and go on to the next house.\n\nOrigin: Originally amazake babā was considered to be a god of disease—specifically smallpox. During smallpox outbreaks, there was a large increase in amazake babā sightings in major urban centers across Japan, not just in the northeast. Rumors of old women roaming the streets at night selling sake and bringing sickness were rampant in large cities such as Edo, Kyōto, Osaka, and Nagoya. Fear of smallpox was a major concern in urban centers, and contributed to the popularity of amazake babā rumors.\n\nSince the eradication of smallpox, the sickness spread by amazake babā’s has changed from smallpox to the common cold. Even today, statues of her can be found in cities. Mothers visit these statues to leave offerings of sake and amazake so that that their children will not become sick.\n\n",

Often it appears near bodies of water such as rivers or lakes, such as Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture. Minobi appears as a number of tiny fireballs which glow like fireflies. They float about in the air and tend gather in large numbers.\n\nInteractions: Minobi gets its name from its tendency to gather around people wearing mino (traditional straw raincoats). It sticks to the raincoat and burns. When someone attempts to brush off or swat out the fire, the minobi instead multiplies, growing larger and larger. Eventually the person is forced to strip off the raincoat and leave it on the road.\n\nOrigin: Minobi is found all over Japan, although often by different names and with different explanations. Sometimes this phenomenon is thought to be caused by natural gas escaping from the ground (as with other mysterious fireballs like onibi and kitsunebi). Most often it is said to be the work of a mischievous kitsune, itachi, or tanuki. Because it appears more frequently during the rainy season, sometimes minobi’s true form is believed to be a firefly or other insect, such as the minomushi (bagworm moth).\n\n",

            "content": "狐憑き\nきつねつきTranslation: fox possession\n\nAppearance: Some kitsune are able to possess human beings and cause them to behave in strange ways. Compared with other types of animal spirit possessions, kitsune tsuki is a relatively common form of possession in humans. A person possessed by a fox spirit often develops physical features that appear fox-like, such as sharper teeth or a streamlined, pointy face. For much of Japanese history—until modern medicine was introduced—mental illness and insanity were usually blamed on kitsune tsuki.\n\nInteractions: There are three main types of kitsune possession: possession of an individual, possession of a family, and possession for use as a medium.\n\nWhen a kitsune possesses an individual, it is often in retaliation for something done to the kitsune—killing one of its family members, for example. The possessing spirit causes its host to behave erratically and emotionally, making them prone to violent outbreaks and hysteria. People possessed by kitsune sometimes run naked through the streets, foam at the mouth, and yelp like a fox. Kitsune can speak through their hosts mouths. Victims are often able to speak and read languages that they previously had no knowledge of. Kitsune can even control their hosts like a puppet, causing them to do all sorts of evil things. According to folklore, women are more susceptible to fox possession than men. Kitsune are also said to possess people who are weak-minded.\n\nWhen a kitsune possesses a family, that family becomes rich and fertile. These families were called kitsune mochi, and were able to manipulate the possessing kitsune spirits. In addition to bringing prosperity to their owners, kitsune could be used to bring ruin upon a family’s enemies. Kitsune mochi people used these spirits to place curses, possess, or bring sickness to others. Kitsune mochi families kept their fox spirits for generations, handing down their secrets from parent to child. A kitsune mochi family would honor and care for its possessing spirit, for it could just as easily bring the same ruin upon their entire family line. People suspected of belonging to kitsune mochi families were mistrusted for their unnatural abilities and feared by their neighbors. Even today, in some parts of Japan, people belonging to these lineages occasionally have trouble finding marriage partners, as few parents would allow their son or daughter to join such a family.\n\nKitsune tsuki for use as a medium involves inviting a kitsune to possess a willing person in order to perform divinations. A kitsune would enter the medium’s body and speak through her mouth, predicting the future or giving secret knowledge. This was a very dangerous practice, as it relies on the willingness of the kitsune to leave the body after the possession—and kitsune are very powerful creatures.\n\nRecognizing possession in a person can be difficult if the victim does not display any obvious physical signs. However, there are a few ways to diagnose kitsune possession. Despite living in a human’s body, kitsune retain certain traits which can betray their presence. All kitsune love fried tofu and azuki beans. A possessed person will strongly crave these foods, often eating them large amounts and not filling up. A possessed person also develops a strong fear of dogs. In addition, a small lump can often be found hidden on the victim’s body. This is the place where the fox spirit resides. If pushed or pricked, this lump slips away and hides in another part of the body. It cannot be caught or removed by any physical means.\n\nBecause of widespread belief in fox possession, a number of folk cures have been invented over the centuries to deal with it. Exorcism was usually performed at Inari shrines, as foxes are sacred to Inari. One fairly benign treatment included having the victim licked from head to toe by dogs, which foxes fear intensely. Other less fortunate victims were beaten or burned in attempts to drive out the fox spirit. In some cases, priests would burn fresh pine leaves, suffocating the patient in thick, toxic smoke in an attempt to drive out the possessing spirit. Unfortunately this sometimes killed the patient before driving out the kitsune. In the end, even if the victim was cured of the possession, the families of people accused of kitsune tsuki often suffered ostracism and social isolation for the rest of their lives.\n\n",

Its name is a play on words, combining the words namekuji (slug) and kujira (whale). In addition to its name, this yōkai’s description contains one more pun. There is a dish made from whale intestines called kujira no hyakuhiro. The name literally means “whale’s 100 hiro,” which comes from the great length of the whale’s intestines.

The voice came from underneath the floorboards, and repeated everything that was said in the house. Everyone in the house was shaken up. They tore up the floorboards to see who was playing a prank on them, but nobody was there.\n\nRumors about the strange voice spread amongst the neighborhood. A group of young men gathered in the farmer’s house to test the phenomenon. Sure enough, anytime one of them spoke, a voice from under the floorboards repeated back whatever they said.\n\nThey tried to guess the source of the voice. One of them called out: “You’re an old tanuki, aren’t you?”\n\n“I am no tanuki!”\n\nAnother young man took a guess: “I know! You’re a kitsune!”\n\n“I am no kitsune!”\n\nOne by one, they took turns guessing what kind of yōkai it was.\n\n“You’re a neko (cat)!”\n\n“An itachi!”\n\n“A kappa!”\n\n“A kawauso!”\n\n“An ugoromochi (mole)!”\n\nThe voice answered no to all of them.\n\nFinally, one of the young men called out half-jokingly, “All right then, you’re a botamochi!”\n\nThe voice replied: “That’s right. I am a botamochi.”\n\nAfter that the mysterious voice was referred to as a botamochi bakemono. News of it traveled throughout the village and eventually reached the castle. A number of government officials were sent to investigate. They spent the night at the farmer’s house and called out to the botamochi bakemono, but the strange voice remained silent for the while night.\n\nAfter the government officials left, the voice once again began to repeat everything that the villagers said. Time and time again, government officials were dispatched to the house, but each time they visited, the botamochi bakemono remained silent. Eventually they had to give up and close their investigation.\n\nAbout one month after the investigation was officially closed, the mysterious voice ceased altogether. It was never heard again.\n\n",

Whatever its original artist intended to represent is lost to history. However, dōmokōmo is also a word with an interesting folk origin. It is an abbreviated version of the phrase dōmokōmo naranai, which means “either way you look at it, it’s impossible.” While there’s no evidence linking dōmokōmo the phrase to dōmokōmo the yōkai, they are nonetheless frequently associated with each other.\n\nLegends: Long ago there were two doctors named Dōmo and Kōmo. Together they were the most skilled doctors in Japan, rivaled only by each other. One day, Dōmo and Kōmo decided to have a competition to see which was the better doctor. They agreed to perform surgery on each other in front of an audience to determine who had higher skill.\n\nDōmo went first. He surgically removed Kōmo’s arm and then reattached it. His expertise was so great that it left no scar. Afterwards, Kōmo cut off Dōmo’s arm and reattached it. Like his rival, he left no mark. Both doctors had cut and reattached so precisely that it was impossible to say who was more skillful.\n\nThey elected to perform a second, more difficult competition. Instead of arms, they would cut off each other’s heads and reattach them. By this time, a large crowd had gathered to watch the spectacle.\n\nThe second competition went much like the first. Kōmo cut off Dōmo’s head and reattached it. Then Dōmo cut off Kōmo’s head and reattached it. Both performed masterfully. Neither was left with so much as a tiny scar. Again, the competition could not be decided.\n\nFinally, Dōmo and Kōmo decided they would cut off each other’s heads simultaneously. The doctors prepared as the crowd watched. They cut off each other’s head at the same time. Without their heads, neither doctor was able to continue the surgery. Nobody was skilled enough to reattach their heads, and Dōmo and Kōmo died.\n\nThe townspeople who had gathered to watch could only say “dōmokōmo naranai”–a pun which translated one way means “neither Dōmo nor Kōmo won.” Translated another way it means “there was no way that was going to work.”\n\n",

He disguised himself as a young student, infiltrated a seminary, and studied Nichiren Buddhism for ten years until his disguise was discovered.\n\nLegends: Long ago, there was a major Buddhist seminary in Iidaka. Young men from all over eastern Japan would go there and study to become priests. Its most famous student, however, was a kitsune named Konoha, who attended the seminary disguised as a boy named Denpachi. Konoha woke up early every morning, transformed into Denpachi, and arrived at school before anyone else.\n\nWhen the other students and teachers arrived each morning, Denpachi would already be there, performing his temple chores like sweeping the floors and preparing meals. Denpachi was an exemplary student. He poured himself into his studies. He performed his ascetic training diligently, and learned to comprehend the deepest esoteric mysteries. From time to time he even instructed the other students in some of the more difficult teachings. Denpachi came to be highly respected among his fellow students and the faculty.\n\nThough he was a diligent student, Denpachi was occasionally careless. Students and teachers discovered fox’s paw prints leading into and out of seminary buildings. Once in a while, leaves onto which Denpachi had copied the Lotus Sutra and accidentally dropped would be found in the gardens. Rumors spread that a kitsune was performing mischief at the seminary. Of course nobody suspected Denpachi.\n\nFor ten years, Denpachi continued to study diligently at Iidaka. One day, a high priest named Saint Nōke was installed as the new headmaster of Iidaka. There was a ceremony and a great banquet. Though alcohol was normally forbidden, the restriction was lifted for the evening, and it turned into a night of wild drinking. The students, including Denpachi, drank themselves into a stupor. Denpachi became so drunk that he lost control over his disguise, and transformed back into a fox.\n\nHis deception revealed, the other students descended upon Denpachi. They tied him up and beat him nearly to death, then dragged him before Saint Nōke for judgment. Denpachi kneeled before the headmaster with tears in his eyes and begged for forgiveness. He explained that his real name was Konoha, and he lived in a hole in the woods near the seminary. He had heard the young priests every day reciting their chants and performing their studies. He wanted to try studying too. So he had disguised himself as a young boy and slipped into the seminary, blending in with the crowds.\n\nSaint Nōke listened to Konoha’s plea. He was touched by the kitsune’s sincerety, his success and diligence as a student, and his passion for helping others. He told the students, “For the teachings of the Lotus Sutra to have reached the heart of this lowly beast, it is truly a marvelous thing!” Saint Nōke forgave Konoha’s deception.\n\nKonoha promised that from then on, he would serve the temple as a guardian spirit and protector of the faith. Saint Nōke built a small shrine for Konoha to live in, in one corner of the lecture hall’s front garden. Konoha’s spirit came to be known as Konoha Inari Daimyōjin, a popular local deity who grants wishes to farmers, merchants, and students. His shrine still stands, and remains a popular place of devotion to this day.\n\n",

It is a type of gakitsuki (possession by gaki–hungry ghosts from Buddhist cosmology).\n\nInteractions: Naegatsuku happens to people when they see the corpse of a drowned victim. How or why it happens in unknown, but merely witnessing a drowned corpse is enough for this possession to occur.\n\nOrigin: Naegatsuku comes from the folklore of Okagaki in Fukuoka Prefecture. The origin of its name is a mystery. Nae may be a local name for a drowned spirit, so it literally means possession by a nae. Based on descriptions of the phenomenon and similarities to other yōkai, a nae sounds very similar to a gaki (preta in Sanskrit). When a person dies with lingering attachment in their heart (such as hunger), their spirit can transform into a hungry ghost called a gaki. Gaki are obsessed with food and driven solely by the desire to eat; yet they are never able to satiate their hunger. Their throats narrow so that they cannot swallow, and whatever food they do eat never satisfies their hunger. Their bellies swell distend from their bodies, their eyes become sunken and their skin becomes thin. Their entire existence is suffering. When gaki possess the living, they impart some of their traits onto their victims–an overwhelming appetite, an inability to swallow food, or physical characteristics such as a distended belly.\n\nLegends: A young man from the village of Hatsu in Okagaki once witnessed the corpse of a person who drowned at sea.

Sometimes their heads attack small animals; sometime they lick up lamp oil with their long tongues; and sometimes they just cause mischief by scaring nearby people.\n\nOrigin: Unlike most yōkai which are born as monsters, rokurokubi and their close relatives nukekubi are former humans—transformed by a curse resulting from some evil or misdeed. Perhaps they sinned against the gods or nature, or perhaps they were unfaithful to their husbands. In many cases, their husbands or fathers actually committed the sin. By some cruel twist of fate the men escape punishment and the women receive the curse instead. In any case, the rokurokubi curse only affects women.\n\nLegends: A lord noticed that the oil in his lamps was vanishing at an alarming rate, and suspected one of his servant girls might be a rokurokubi. He decided to spy upon the girl. After she had fallen asleep, he crept into her room and watched over her. Soon he noticed vapors and ectoplasm forming around her chest and neck. A little while later, the servant girl rolled over in her sleep, however only her body moved! The head stayed in its place, and the neck lay stretched out between the two. The next day he fired her. She was fired from every place at which she subsequently worked. The poor girl never understood why she had such back luck with her employment. She never found out that she was a rokurokubi.\n\nAn old tale from Tōtōmi Province (Shizuoka Prefecture) tells of a monk who eloped with a young lady named Oyotsu. While traveling, Oyotsu became sick. Treating her would have used up all of their travel money, so the monk murdered Oyotsu and stole the remaining money. On his travels, he stayed at an inn owned by a man with a beautiful daughter. The wicked monk shared a bed with the innkeeper’s daughter, and during the night her neck stretched and her face changed into that of Oyotsu. She angrily accused him of murdering her. The next morning the monk, regretting his evil deeds, confessed the murder of Oyotsu to the innkeeper. The monk also told the innkeeper what he had seen the night before. The innkeeper confessed that he, too, had murdered his wife for her money. He used the money to build his inn, and as a punishment his own daughter was transformed into a rokurokubi. Afterwards, the monk rejoined his temple, built a grave for Oyotsu, and prayed for her soul every day. What happened to the innkeeper’s daughter is never mentioned.\n\n",

She haunted a mountain pass called Tachimi tōge. She is most famous for disguising herself as a prostitute named Otomi and bewitching men crossing through the mountains, and for her ability to escape capture over and over. Her name Otomi jorō (Otomi the prostitute) was shortened over time into the nickname Otonjorō.\n\nHer favorite food was said to be fried rat, and if you put up a bunch of them for sale she was sure to come and try to buy one. She transformed leaves into one sen coins and used them to buy the friend rats. Sellers would try to rip the coins in half before accepting them. If it didn’t rip, it was a genuine coin. But if it ripped, it was a transformed leaf, and the person buying your fried rats was actually Otonjorō.\n\nA number of famous kitsune come from this region. Together they are known as the Inaba Five Kitsune. In addition to Otonjorō, the other four are her husband Keizōbō, Shoroshoro kitsune, Onashi gitsune, and Onji no kitsune.\n\nLegends: One night, a merchant was traveling through the Tachimi pass on his way to the castle. On the road up ahead he spotted a young woman wearing a kerchief. The merchant thought to himself that she must be the wicked Otonjorō, out hunting for men.\n\nThe woman called out to the merchant, “Oh merchant! Would you take me to a nearby village and help me find someone who would take me as a bride?” He decided to trick her before she could trick him. He could take her to his friend Jūbē’s house, and together they would capture her and make her suffer. He put on his best poker face and told her to come with him.\n\nHe led her to Jūbē’s house, only to discover it was already decorate in preparation to receive a bride. It was quite late at night, but Jūbē’s servants welcomed him inside, and treated him with the greatest hospitality. They offered him a nice hot bath, which sounded just wonderful to the road-weary merchant. He soaked in the hot bath for some time, and eventually the sky began to lighten as dawn approached.\n\nThe village’s farmers awoke with the dawn and headed out into the fields. They called out, “Look over there! That merchant must have been bewitched by Otonjorō! He’s washing himself in the dung pots!” The merchant suddenly found himself sitting naked in a dung tank in the middle of a field, rubbing fertilizer into his face, surrounded by laughing farmers. The whole night had been an illusion.\n\nAnother legend tells of a village headman who could no longer contain his anger at Otonjorō’s constant mischief. He called all the villagers together and promised to greatly reward anyone who would exterminate the kitsune. A pair of braggadocious young men volunteered to take her down.\n\nThe men ventured into the mountains to look for Otonjorō. Soon they reached Tachimi tōge, where they spied a fox walking along a small river up ahead of them. They watched as the creature rubbed river mud all over its body, and transformed into a young woman. Then, she picked up a river stone and transformed it into a baby, which she cradled in her arms. The two men followed her all the way to a small mountain hovel, which she entered.\n\nPeering into the hovel, the young men saw an old man and an old woman gleefully cradling the stone baby. They burst inside and told the elderly couple that the baby was a stone, and that they had been bewitched by a kitsune. But no matter how much they explained, the old couple would not hear it. They kept insisting that the baby was their own grandchild.\n\nThe young men had enough. To prove the baby was just an illusion, they snatched it up from the elderly couple and dropped it into a boiling pot. The baby screamed, and died, and did not not turn back into rock. The young men were horrified. The elderly couple were furious. They overpowered the shocked young men and tied them up, then called for someone to fetch the town magistrate to come arrest them.\n\nA passing priest heard them, and said that he had a better idea. They should give the two criminals to his temple, and he would ensure they spend the rest of their lives praying for the soul of the dead grandchild. The elderly couple agreed. The young men shaved their heads, and traveled into the mountains to join the priest’s temple to pray for the soul of the baby they had killed.\n\nSome time passed, and people back in the village began to worry about the fate of the two strong young men. They sent a search party into the mountains to find them. Near Tachimi tōge, by a small river, they discovered the two young men sitting river mud. Their heads were shaved, and they were reciting the name of Buddha over and over while striking a river rock.\n\n",

They appear in many forms, but are often depicted as small, savage demons.\n\nBehavior: Hōsōgami travel from town to town, infecting entire communities of people with smallpox. They have fearsome tempers, which are reflected in the ferocity and virulence of smallpox. They are afraid of dogs, and they hate the color red. This is because the color red was considered to be a symbol of good health, and a red rash covering the body was a good sign of recovery from smallpox.\n\nInteractions: In houses where smallpox infections appeared, family members erected smallpox shrines and begged the hōsōgami to spare their loved ones. Although hōsōgami were feared and considered to be evil gods, it was believed that–like other yakubyō gami–they could be appeased with rituals and offerings. Red woodblock prints called akae were hung around the house to scare them off. All sorts of objects were believed to have protective powers, such as red-papered priest staves and red clothing. Other talismans included dolls and toys in the shape of dogs, owls, sea breams, cows, and the red-haired yōkai shōjō. Images of Daruma, Shōki, and Kintarō were also popular charms.\n\nSome gods were seen as particularly effective against smallpox. Shrines to the warrior Minamoto no Tametomo were thought to be effective at keeping hōsōgami away. When Minamoto no Tametomo fled to Hachijōjima during the Hōgen Rebellion, smallpox ravaged every part of the country except for Hachijōhima. It was believed that he drove the sickness from those islands. The Shintō god of healing Sukunabikona was also a popular target of worship for those afflicted with smallpox.\n\nBecause smallpox affects entire communities rather than just individuals, a number of community rituals called hōsōgami okuri (“sending off the hōsōgami”) were developed in response to outbreaks. Bands of people playing drums, flutes, and bells would parade around the streets performing songs and dances to ward off the sickness. Small wayshrines and stone pagodas were erected at the outskirts of villages to keep them from entering.\n\nIn some areas, hōsōgami were not viewed as the cause of smallpox but as the saviors of people from the disease. In such cases, smallpox was seen as a physical manifestation of the evil inside of the human body. The infected would pray to hōsōgami for protection and salvation. Survivors of the disease would offer thanks to the hōsōgami for saving them.\n\nOrigin: Smallpox is believed to have made its first appearance in Japan in the Nara Period, a time of great exchange with continental Asia. The first recorded smallpox epidemic in Japan, which crossed over from the Korean peninsula to Japan in 735 CE, is described in  the Heian Period history record Shoku nihongi. Japan’s earliest outbreaks started in Dazaifu and from there spread to the rest of the country. Dazaifu was an important center of politics and international exchange, making it an ideal port of entry for smallpox.\n\nNot all outbreaks of smallpox were caused by hōsōgami. Dazaifu is also famous for being the home of the exiled scholar Sugawara no Michizane. After Michizane’s death, an outbreak of smallpox and the deaths of a number of his rivals, including the emperor, were blamed on his restless spirit. It was believed that Michizane had become a tatarigami–a curse-spreading god. His curse ended when his titles were posthumously restored and he was enshrined as the kami Tenjin.\n\nLegends: An eyewitness account of a hōsōgami was reported in Nisshin shinjishi, a Meiji Period newspaper. A rickshaw driver in Honjo, Tōkyō reported that he gave a ride to a young girl about 14 or 15 years old. She asked him to drive her from Midorichō to Asakusa. Midway through the ride it began to grow dark, so the rickshaw driver pulled over to light a lantern. However, when he stopped, he noticed that the girl had vanished from the back of his rickshaw. In her place, there was a rice barrel lid with a red staff mounted to it. He recognized the barrel lid with the red staff as a symbol of a hōsōgami.\n\nThe young girl he had given a ride to must have been a hōsōgami using the rickshaw system to find her next victim!\n\n",

They appear as ōnyūdō–giant monks–who materialize near their trees. These monks have round, red faces that resemble persimmons.\n\nBehavior: Tantan kororin appear beneath unharvested persimmon trees late in the evening. They fill up their sleeves with ripe, fallen fruit and then wander about town. The persimmons spill out from their overfull sleeves as they wanders, spreading seeds over a wide area. Eventually the spirits run out of persimmons, return to their trees, and vanish.\n\nInteractions: Tantan kororin do not harm people, but they are creepy to look at. Thus, most people stay indoors and away from these spirits when one is spotted.\n\nOrigin: Tantan kororin comes from the folklore of Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. It was described by Yanagita Kunio in Yōkai dangi. The original meaning of its name was never recorded; however kororin is an onomatopoeia for the sound of things rolling around, so it’s possible that the name comes from the sound of persimmons falling and rolling on the ground.\n\nTantan kororin is often confused with a yōkai from Aomori Prefecture called tankororin. This confusion is in part due to the fact that Mizuki Shigeru recorded the story of tantan kororin under the name tankororin. In Aomori, misbehaving children are warned that tankororin will come for them. What exactly tankororin is or does is unknown, as well as whether it is even related to persimmons at all.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Sendai, there was an old house with five or six large persimmon trees. The people who lived in the house were very old, and they no longer had the strength to pick the persimmons from their trees. So the persimmons just hung in the trees until they fell off on their own. One day the villagers noticed a man who looked a monk wandering about the town. His sleeves were stuffed full of ripe persimmons, which continuously dropped out from his sleeves and rolled away as he walked. They were scared of the man, so they followed him from a distance to see what he was doing. Eventually, he wandered back through the gate of the old house, walked up to a persimmon tree, and vanished.\n\nAt a temple in the mountains, a strange man approached a young monk. The man used a mortar to grind up his own feces into a paste, and the ordered the young monk to eat the paste. The young monk protested, but the man became angrier and angrier, until the young monk had no choice but to obey. He was shocked to discover that the man’s feces were sweet and tasted just like a delicious persimmon. Later, the young monk told the temple’s high priest what had happened. The two of them searched for the strange man together. They saw him climb deep into the mountains and disappear. They followed his trail all the way to an huge, old persimmon tree loaded with ripe fruit. The high priest believed the man must have been the spirit of the persimmon tree. They gathered up all of the ripe fruits and brought them back to the temple. The strange man was never seen again after that.\n\nIn Kurihara, Miyagi, a serving girl looked out at the splendid persimmon tree in her master’s yard. It was full of ripe, delicious-looking persimmons. She longed to pick and eat one. That night, a strange man with a bright red face appeared by her side. He ordered the girl to dig at his rear end with a skewer. Too terrified to disobey, the girl did as she was told. Then, the red-faced man ordered her to lick the skewer. To her surprise, the man’s rear tasted like sweet persimmons. The following morning she looked out at the persimmon tree again, and she saw that the persimmons had finger-sized holes gouged out of them.\n\n",

It is white, with large eyes that stare off into the distance as if lost in thought. It floats about in the air, aimlessly wandering about.\n\nOrigin: Shiro ukari appears on a few Edo period scroll paintings, and nowhere else. It was invented by an artist rather than recorded from folklore. Aside from its name, nothing is written about it. Everything about it, including its behavior and its origin, is unknown and unexplained. However, its name may be a clue to its origin.\n\nWhile it shiro ukari literally means “white floater,” both of these words carry a number of nuances which could refer to this spirit’s true nature. Shiro not only refers to the color white, but to a state of total innocence or naivety. Whereas ao (blue) is used in many yokai to refer to a novice or an apprentice, shiro can refer to a state of total, absolute naivete. It has a negative connotation, akin to a “fool” or a “country bumpkin” in English. The urban socialites of Edo looked down on the “shiro” people who lived in the rural areas outside of the capital. While not specifically stated, the vacant expression on this yōkai’s face could be an allusion to this alternate meaning of shiro.\n\nUkari comes from the word for floating, which has a number of different implications. The most literal meaning is to float about from place to place. There is also a nuance of absentmindedness or disconnect from others. Tourists who feel out of place in a strange city might be described as floating about in this way. It can also refer to merrymaking, particularly in a way that is disconnected with the real world. This is the same origin as the word ukiyo, which refers to the “floating world”—the urban, pleasure-seeking lifestyle of old Edo. In a spiritual sense, this word can also refer to spirits which have not been able to pass on to the next world due to the weight of their sins. They float about, but never ascend, and are doomed to haunt this world.\n\nPerhaps shiro ukari is a pun describing the uncouth, naive rural bumpkins who Edo urbanites thought had no business being in their city. Their experience in the capital might be something like a wide-eyed ghost floating from place to place. Perhaps it is a yōkai which seeks out the impermanent pleasures of life just as the humans of old Edo did. Or perhaps it is the spirit of someone who is unable to ascend into the next world, and they are forced by the weight of their sins to float about and wander aimlessly for the rest of their existence.\n\n",

They appear on cloudy days. They are a kind of diving doppelganger; they take on the appearance of the ama who see them. The only way to tell them apart from actual women is the length of the headbands they wear; tomokazuki have much longer headbands.\n\nInteractions: Tomokazuki appear to divers deep underwater. They beckon the divers closer to them, offering shellfish and sea urchins as a way to lure them deeper. They continue to lure the divers deeper and farther away from safety. Eventually the divers are either lured too deep or too far from the shore, and they drown.\n\nIn order to protect themselves from tomokazuki, superstitious ama will carry magic charms with them while diving; usually in the form of the seiman and dōman symbols on their headbands.\n\nOrigin: One popular explanation among believers is that tomokazuki are the ghosts of drowned ama. Since they are only ever seen by ama deep under the water, belief in tomokazuki is not common. Most of the time, tales of tomokazuki encounters are written off as hallucinations or delirium brought on by the stresses of deep diving—high pressure, lack of oxygen, physical exhaustion, and the fear of being swept away.\n\nIn one story from Shizuoka, an ama and her husband took a boat out to sea to dive for shellfish. While deep underweater, the ama saw a tomokazuki and quickly surfaced to tell her husband. He mocked her for believing such stupid things, and ordered her to keep working. The ama dove back down as her husband commanded. She was never seen again.\n\nIn Fukui Prefecture there is yōkai called an umiama, which is very similar to a tomokazuki. When an ama dives down to the sea floor, the umiama surfaces. Then, when the ama surfaces, the umiama dives down to the sea floor. Because of this, it is very difficult to spot this yōkai. However, those unlucky few who do manage to see it become gravely ill shortly afterwards.\n\n",

She lived in a pond called Naisuke ga fuchi in Kawachi Province (present-day Ōsaka Prefecture). She was named for a pattern in her scales that looked like a tomoe–a comma-like emblem used in heraldry.\n\nOrigin: Tomoe’s story is recorded in Saikaku shokoku banashi, a collection of stories published in 1685. The lake that she lived in was also known as Nairiso fuchi. It no longer exists, as it was drained for flood control infrastructure. Its former location is marked with a memorial stone.\n\nLegends: Long ago, near the Neya River, there was a large pond called Naisuke ga fuchi. Naisuke ga fuchi was famous for never drying up and for its wonderful fish. A single house stood by the pond, belonging to a man named Naisuke. He had no wife or children. He made his living by fishing on the pond in his small boat.\n\nOne day Naisuke caught a female koi with a splendid appearance and brave demeanor which made it stand out among the rest of his catch. Day after day, all of the fish in his tank were sold except for the female koi. For some reason she was always left unsold. She had a tomoe-shaped pattern in her scales. Naisuke named the koi Tomoe, and he became quite attached her.\n\nOver time, Naisuke grew more and more fond of Tomoe. And the koi seemed to like him back. She seemed to be able to understand her own name, reacting like a human when he called her. Sometimes he took her out of the holding pond and let her sleep by his side in the house. As time passed, Tomoe even learned to eat meals like a human.\n\nTomoe grew larger and larger ever year. Eighteen years after she was caught, she had grown to the size of a fourteen or fifteen year old girl. Naisuke had aged too; now an elderly man, he accepted a marriage offer from an older, unwed woman in his village.\n\nNot long after Naisuke’s bride came to live with him, Naisuke went out fishing all night and left his wife was alone at home. A beautiful young woman wearing a light blue kimono covered in crashing waves barged into the house through the back door. She glared at Naisuke’s wife and said, “Naisuke and I have been together for years, and I am even carrying his child! Now you dare act like his bride? I cannot contain my hatred! Leave our home immediately! If you do not, in three days I will call a giant wave to wash this entire house into the pond!” Then she vanished.\n\nWhen Naisuke returned home, his terrified wife told him what had happened. Naisuke said that he had no memory of such a person.\n\n“A beautiful young lady like you describe would surely have no interest in a poor, old fisherman like me!” he laughed. “You must have dreamed her up!\n\nThe following night, Naisuke went out fishing again. Suddenly, the water became rough. The algae on the surface parted, and an enormous koi leapt up out of the pond and onto the boat. It opened its mouth and spat out something that looked like a human fetus. Then it slipped back below the water and disappeared.\n\nNaisuke returned home in a panic. He rushed over to the holding pond where Tomoe lived, but she was nowhere to be found.\n\nNaisuke’s story spread around town. The villagers all agreed that people really shouldn’t allow themselves to get so attached to their pets.\n\n",

She picked up a large sack and hiked into the mountains to look for a pear tree.\n\nThe wife climbed deep into the mountains, and finally came upon a splendid pear tree. The ground was covered in ripe pears that had fallen from the tree. Delighted, she filled her sack up, slung it over her shoulder, and prepared for the return hike home. However, by then the sky had grown dark, and it was dangerous to make the trek home at night. She decided to tie the sack of pears to a branch, then climb up into the pear tree and wait until morning.\n\nBefore long, she heard the drums and cymbals of a funeral procession. A voice called out, “Where is the wild pear tree? Where is the wild pear tree?” The woman was terrified. A funeral procession at this hour must be an evil spirit.\n\nThe voice drew close and said, “Here it is! Here it is!” It came right below the pear tree, dug a hole in the earth, and buried a human corpse in it. The wife climbed higher up into the tree to get away, but the spirit heard her and said, “What have we here? I’m going to eat you!” A cold and slimy hand stretched up towards the wife. It grabbed her leg and knocked her out of the tree. She fell to the ground and was gobbled up.\n\nHer husband and son searched and searched for her, but she never turned up. All they found was the sack of pears tied to the branch. They realized she must have been taken by an evil spirit.\n\nYears later, when her son grew up, he decided to take revenge for his mother. He grabbed his rifle and climbed the mountains to the pear tree where she had disappeared. He waited until it grew dark. He heard the same strange funeral procession that his mother had heard so long ago. The same voice chanted, “Where is the wild pear tree? Where is the wild pear tree?”\n\nThe young man aimed his rifle and fired. An eerie laughter erupted from the direction he fired. He had missed. Then, a big, blue ball of flame floated towards him. A voice said, “What have we here? I’m going to eat you!”\n\nThis time the young man shot the flame. He heard a terrible scream and the flame was extinguished.\n\nWhen morning came, the young man went to see what it was he had shot. He found the dead body of an enormous mujina—a badger.

The demons he defeats sometimes become his servants. It is said that he commands 80,000 demons.\n\nOrigin: Shōki originated in ancient China during the 700’s. His story reached Japan by the late Heian period, and his popularity reached its height during the Edo period. Paintings and statues of him are still used as a good luck charms. His image appears on flags, folding screens, and hanging scrolls. Small statues of him can sometimes be seen on the roofs of older houses in Kyoto as well. Shōki is strongly associated with Boys’ Day, a holiday in May. He is revered as a god of protection from demons and sickness (particularly smallpox, which was believed to be spread by evil spirits), and also as a god of scholarship.\n\nLegends: Shōki lived in Shanxi Province in China during the Tang dynasty. His life’s goal was to become a physician in the court of Emperor Xuanzong. Shōki was a smart and diligent student. He trained hard and passed all of the exams to become a physician. He placed first out of all of the applicants and should have easily received the position. However, Shōki was a very ugly man. When the emperor saw his face, he immediately rejected Shōki’s application even though he was the most qualified for the job.\n\nShōki was devastated. His dreams shattered, he committed suicide on the steps of the imperial palace. The emperor was moved by Shōki’s dedication. He felt great regret for denying the application of such a talented and brilliant man on account of his looks. The emperor ordered that Shōki should receive a state burial of the highest rank—usually only reserved for royalty—and posthumously awarded him the title “Doctor of Zhongnanshan.”\n\nYears later, the emperor became gravely ill. Delirious with fever, he dreamed that he saw two oni. The larger one was wearing the clothing of a court official. It grabbed the smaller oni, killed it, and ate it. Then, it turned to the emperor and introduced itself as Shōki. He vowed to protect the emperor from evil. When the emperor woke up, his fever was gone.\n\nXuanzong commissioned the court painter to make an painting of Shōki based on his dream. Shōki became a popular deity across China (and later, Japan). He was revered as a god of scholarship for his great devotion to his studies, and as a protector against disease and evil spirits.\n\n",

It is wrapped in a ragged shroud, with only its bleached skull and tangled hair emerging from its tattered clothes.\n\nBehavior: Kyōkotsu are formed from bones which were improperly disposed of by being discarded down a well. The bones may come from a murder or a suicide victim, or someone who died after accidentally falling into a well. The lack of a proper burial—and the egregious disrespect shown by discarding bones in this manner—creates a powerful grudge in those bones. This transforms the deceased into a shiryō. Like other ghosts, they pass their grudge on to those they come in contact with. A kyōkotsu lies at the bottom of its well until it is disturbed, then it rises up to curse anyone unfortunate enough to be using the well.\n\nOrigin: Kyōkotsu was invented by Toriyama Sekien for his book Konjaku hyakki shūi. In his description, he writes that this yōkai’s name is the origin of the word kyōkotsu, which means fury and violence. While there is a word in a local dialect of Kanagawa which does match this description, there is no evidence actually linking it to this yōkai. It is more likely that Toriyama Sekien—who was fond of wordplay—actually created this yōkai based on words in local dialects and just made up a false etymology to make the story more interesting.\n\n",

Their body shape resembles a hammer or a mallet head with no handle. They range in size from thirty to eighty centimeters long. Their scaly skin is speckled in various earth tones, and they have light-colored bellies. Their viper-like fangs carry a deadly venom. Unlike snakes, tsuchinoko have eyelids. Due to their shape and color they are often said to resemble beer bottles.\n\nBehavior: Tsuchinoko are found throughout Japan. They are active during the day from spring through fall, and hibernate through the winter. They make their nests in holes along wooded riverbanks. They give off a call which sounds like “chee,” and they snore when they sleep.\n\nTsuchinoko feed on insects when they are young, and frogs and mice as they grow larger. There are occasional reports of them eating larger animals like cats or dogs. They can eat vast quantities of food for their small size. They are also quite fond of sake. They are attracted to the smell of miso, dried squid, and burning hair.\n\nDespite their awkward shape, tsuchinoko are extremely nimble. They can move about like an inchworm, but they are best known for their habit of rolling and tumbling about. They can roll sideways like a log, or tumble vertically from tip-to-tail. They can also swallow their tail–making their body into a ring–and roll like a wheel. Tsuchinoko are great jumpers as well. By some estimates, they can jump from two to five meters.\n\nOrigin: Creatures resembling tsuchinoko have been part of Japanese folklore since prehistoric times. Jomon period pottery and stone tools with motifs resembling stumpy snakes have been discovered. During the Edo Period, a number of venomous, rolling, snake-like yōkai–such as the nozuchi and tsuchi korobi–were recorded in folkloric encyclopedias.\n\nTsuchinoko became a national sensation during the 1970’s, when a number of sightings and supposed live captures of tsuchinoko were reported. This sparked a “tsuchinoko boom,” and people all over the country began hunting for tsuchinoko. An explosion of eyewitness accounts, blurry photographs, and talk show specials cemented tsuchinoko as a household term. Since then, it has remained an extremely popular subject among cryptozoologists, with monetary rewards occasionally offered to anyone able to produce a photograph or a physical specimen.\n\nTsuchinoko are known by many regional names, such as bachihebi, dotenko, inokohebi, korohebi, tatekurikaeshi, tsuchinbo, tsuchihebi, and so on. They are also sometimes considered to be identical to the yōkai nozuchi or tsuchi korobi–although others say that they are separate creatures.\n\n",

There is an expression in Japanese—”dono tsura sagete“—which is used to scold a person who looks inappropriately calm when they should be ashamed of something they’ve done. The connotation of this idiom is to lower a mask over one’s face, as in, “How dare you come here wearing that face!”; however, taken literally it means to “lower a face,” just as this yōkai’s face has been lowered down to his torso.\n\n",

They resemble weasels or mice, or very small foxes. Some accounts describe them as a cross between a fox and an owl, a little bit larger than a house mouse. Their fur is mottled and can be brown, grey, red, white, or orange. Their noses are white at the tip. Their ears look like human ears. They sometimes have a black stripe which runs from their nose to their tail.\n\nBecause of their small size, magical powers, and ability to hide on the human body, they are often confused with kudagitsune.\n\nBehavior: Osaki live in the mountains, but also find their ways into human villages and homes. They are usually invisible to the human eye, but will show themselves at the sound of a pot lid or a rice container being struck. They are extremely fast, so they appear and disappear suddenly. They reproduce quickly, forming large packs and moving together as a swarm. Like other kitsune, they are famous for their magical abilities, and are often used by the gods as divine messenger animals.\n\nOsaki are found in Nagano and throughout most of the Kantō region. Within Tokyo, however, they are only found in the Okutama mountains in the far west of the prefecture. This is due to the influence of the Ōji Inari Shrine, the head shrine for kitsune in the Kantō Region, which forbade low-ranking kitsune like osaki from entering Edo.\n\nInteractions: Osaki are used by humans as magical familiars in the same way that other types of kitsune are. If kept happy, osaki are able to bring material wealth to their owners and ruin to their owners’ enemies. Families which control osaki are known as osaki moch or osaki tsukai. Osaki mochi families find incredible wealth and prosperity, while the fortunes of their neighbors mysteriously fall. When an osaki mochi family’s fortunes rise, they overflow with wealth. Conversely, if their fortunes fall, they fall into complete and utter ruin and never recovers.\n\nGreat care was taken to keep this status secret. Osaki mochi families were historically shunned and mistrusted for their unnatural abilities. They often withdrew from society and avoided contact with the outside world.\n\nOsaki possession is passed down from generation to generation matrilineally. Marrying into an osaki mochi family would make the other family osaki mochi too. If a bride was discovered to be osaki mochi, the wedding would immediately be called off. Marriage was only permitted with other osaki mochi families. Once a family became osaki mochi, they would always be osaki mochi. There is no magic ritual capable of removing osaki from a family line. In a way, rather than the family possessing osaki, the osaki possess the family.\n\nLike other kinds of kitsune, osaki are capable of entering human bodies. This power is called kitsune tsuki, and is used against people who have wronged the osaki or its human family. Victims of osaki possession are struck with bad luck and mysterious injuries. They develop fevers, mental and physical agitation, gluttonous appetites, and other eccentricities. This possession can only be cured through difficult exorcisms. Villagers are cautioned not to tease wild osaki in order to avoid invoking their curse.\n\nOrigin: Osaki are said to come from the great nine-tailed kitsune Tamamo no Mae. When she was killed, her body transformed into a great cursed stone called Sesshō seki. Its curse was ended when the priest Gennō smashed the rock into pieces, which then flew across the country. Some of the pieces of Tamamo no Mae’s tails landed in Gunma and transformed into the first osaki.\n\nThe name osaki can be written with a number of kanji combinations, reflecting its diverse history. The most common writing is 尾先, meaning “tail tip.” This comes from the fact that the creatures were formed from the shattered tips of Tamamo no Mae’s nine tails. An alternate writing of its name uses the kanji 尾裂, meaning “split tail.” This refers to the fact that osaki have two tails. Yet another version uses the kanji 御先, which comes from the word misaki and refers to animal spirits employed by the gods.\n\n",

It is jealously guarded by the few who know it, and strongly coveted by those who don’t.\n\nOrigin: This spell was developed in ancient China by Taoist philosophers. It is named for Lord Taizan, the god of the mountain Taishan in Shandong, China and one of the kings of hell. He is one of the most important deities in Onmyōdō. In this ritual, the supplicant beseeches Lord Taizan, Great King Enma, and the other judges of Meido and Jigoku to lengthen a person’s life span, save someone from death, or even restore life to the dead. Gold, silver, silk, saddled horses, and human life—usually substitutes in the form of katashiro, or paper dolls—are offered to the gods. No mantras or magical worlds are spoken; the gods are simply invited to sit down and participate. A formal letter of request is read to them, detailing the offerings and the virtues of the supplicants, and the precise divine intervention desired.\n\nThe Abe clan was famous for their knowledge of this spell. It is one of the reasons they were able to maintain a monopoly on the imperial Bureau of Onmyōdō. Under their offices, this spell was routinely performed for the emperors in order to increase their life spans and protect the country.\n\nLegends: Abe no Seimei is particularly famous for his use of Taizan Fukun no Sai. He resurrected his father, who was murdered by Ashiya Dōman, and used it many other times in the service of the emperor and country.\n\nOnce, a high ranking monk of Mii-dera known as Chikō fell gravely ill. It was determined that his illness was the result of karma, and thus could not be cured with medicine. Abe no Seimei was summoned. He divined Chikō’s fortune, and discovered that death was imminent. However, Abe no Seimei said that if someone was willing to trade life spans with Chikō, he could perform the Taizan Fukun no Sai and save the priest’s life.\n\nThe priests all looked at each other uncomfortably. As much as they loved and admired Chikō, nobody was willing to sacrifice his own life in order to save him. Finally, a young man named Shōkū—an average pupil who had been studying for many years yet had never attracted the attention of Chikō or the other teachers—stepped forward and offered his own life.\n\nAbe no Seimei accepted the offer. He immediately performed the Taizan Fukun no Sai. Shōkū writhed in anguish, his life span shrinking away, while Chikō rapidly began to recover. Finally, Chikō was cured, and Shōkū lay on death’s door. As the young pupil’s last breath left his body, he prayed with all his heart to a nearby painting of Fudō Myōō. Just then, tears poured from the painted eyes of Fudō Myōō, and the god’s voice was heard:\n\n“If you would take the place of your teacher, then let me take your place instead.”\n\nSuddenly, Shōkū and Chikō sat up, both of then restored to life.\n\n",

She wears a furisode kimono, usually worn by young, unmarried women.\n\nOrigin: Shumoku musume is not a major yōkai, yet her image is fairly well known. This is because she was included in obake karuta, a yōkai-themed version of the popular card matching game karuta. Although no story accompanies her in obake karuta, her card says that she appears on the Usui Pass, which separates Gunma and Nagano Prefectures.\n\nThe word shumoku refers to the wooden hammers used to strike temple bells.

They are also depicted in the illustrated Edo period ghost story collection Ehon hyakumonogatari.\n\nLegends: During the 1240’s CE, three wicked samurai named Kosanta, Matashige, and Akugorō were in the town of Manazuru for a festival. They became very drunk and started to argue. Their quarrel got so heated that they drew their swords and began to fight. In the midst of their violent fight, they managed to cut off each others’ heads. Their severed heads rolled away and fell into the sea. However, death did not settle their disagreement. They turned into onryō. The heads floated up to the surface and began to bite and breath flames at each other, locked in an undying argument.\n\nThe onryō of the three warriors still haunt the sea around Manazuru. At night they can be seen dancing on the sea’s surface as they spit fire snap at each other. Locals of Manazuru fear the area and call it tomoe ga fuchi (“the tomoe depths”). When waves shaped like three tomoe appear on the surface, they stay away from waters out of fear of shipwrecks and other disasters caused by maikubi.\n\n",

She was a malicious troublemaker, and loved playing tricks on the humans who lived near her home. Her signature prank was to attack travelers on the road and shave them bald.\n\nLegends: A fishmonger was carrying his daily catch through the hills when an elegant looking lady approached him and asked him to sell her some fish. She said she was having a party, and wanted every single fish he had. The fisherman was shocked. He had never traded all of his fish in a single day before. He happily sold his catch to the woman, and went home early.\n\nHis wife was surprised to hear his story. She thought it was strange, as there were no families with that kind of money living anywhere near those hills. On second thought, the fisherman agreed it was strange. He opened up his purse, but the coins the woman had paid with were gone. All that was inside was a handful of leaves. He realized that he must have been tricked by Okon gitsune.\n\nThe fisherman decided to find the kitsune and punish her. He grabbed a wooden staff and went back to the hills. The day grew late, but he could not find the kitsune anywhere. Suddenly, he heard a call from down the road. A daimyō’s procession was heading up the hill and straight his way! The soldiers at the front of the procession were ordering him to make way.\n\nThe fisherman jumped off the road and prostrated himself before the procession. He bowed his head, and the ground rumbled as soldiers, horses, and the daimyo’s palanquin passed. Suddenly, it struck him as odd that daimyō would process through this rural stretch of hills. He though that this must be Okon gitsune playing a trick on him. Now was his chance to punish her! The fisherman jumped up and approached the daimyō’s palanquin. He tried to pull open the door.\n\n“INSOLENT PEASANT!” came a voice from the palanquin.\n\nThe daimyō’s guards seized the fisherman and forced him to the ground. The daimyō stepped out of his palanquin. He drew his sword from its sheath and raised it to cut off the fisherman’s head. The fisherman groveled and begged the daimyō to spare his life.\n\nThe daimyō’s rage subsided. “Very well. You may live, but you must shave your head to show repentance.”\n\nGuards held the fisherman down and cut all the hair from his head. The fisherman grovelled on the side of the road until the procession left. He had his life, but everyone in the village would tease him for this. He wrapped his head in a kerchief and sheepishly returned home.\n\nHis wife was shocked to see him return shaven and ashamed. Even more so when she heard his story. There was no way a daimyō would travel through such rural, backwater hills. The whole procession was clearly a trick. Her husband bad been fooled by Okon gitsune again.\n\n“But,” she point out, “whether it was a kitsune or not, if you had just bowed your head and let the procession pass, you would still have your hair…”\n\n",

He was renowned for his skill at performing The Tale of the Heike–particularly his rendition of the Battle of Dan no ura and the death of the child emperor Antoku. His playing was said to be so splendid that he could even make ghosts and demons cry.\n\nOrigin: Hōichi’s story is famous even outside of Japan thanks to Lafcadio Hearn’s 1904 book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things. Hearn’s version was based on Isseki Sanjin’s telling of the story in Gayū kidan, published in 1782. Although this version is the most famous, there are other versions with variations in details such as location (one takes place in Tokushima, another in Nagano), the name of the main character (Dan’ichi in one version, Un’ichi in another), and so on.\n\nHōichi’s story may be originally based on a real life 14th century priest named Akashi Kakuichi. Kakuichi became a blind later in life and took up the biwa. He soon surpassed his own master, and he became one of the most influential biwa masters in Japan. His version of The Tale of the Heike is considered the standard to this day.\n\nHōichi’s temple, Amidaji in Shimonoseki is now known as Akama jingū, a shinto shrine dedicated to Emperor Antoku. Its grounds contain a small shrine dedicated to Hōichi, and a gravesite of fourteen Heike members. Every so often, there are reports of restless Heike ghosts sighted in and around the shrine grounds.\n\nLegends: One night a samurai visited Hōichi and demanded he perform for his lord. The samurai led the blind Hōichi to the place where his lord and court were gathered. It seemed that a large number of people were in attendance. A voice commanded him to play the Battle of Dan no ura from the Tale of the Heike.\n\nHōichi played, and was surprised at the dramatic reaction to his performance. At the climax of the story, when he told of the defeat of the Heike and the drowning of the young emperor, every one began weeping loudly. When he was finished, they praised his skill. A voice asked him to return again the following night. Then the samurai escorted Hōichi back to his temple. The samurai commaned Hōichi to tell nobody what had happened.\n\nThe next evening, the samurai returned for Hōichi. Once again, Hōichi played, moving his audience to tears. The high priest of Amidaji noticed that Hōichi had been leaving at night and not returning until morning. When he asked Hōichi where he was going, Hōichi refused to tell. The priest was worried, and ordered his servants to follow Hōichi.\n\nThat night, the samurai once again came for Hōichi. The temple servants followed Hōichi to an old Heike family graveyard. Hōichi sat down before the grave of Emperor Antok. As he passionately played his biwa, orbs of ghostly fire flared up and danced in the air around him. The servants realized that Hōichi was in terrible danger. They dragged him away from the graves and back to the temple and told the high priest what had happened.\n\nThe high priest explained to Hōichi that nobles he had encountered were in truth vengeful ghosts who had perished at the Battle of Dan no ura. They would not be satisfied with his performance; they would kill him and take his soul. The ghosts would surely return for Hōichi the following night. The priest painted the words of the Heart Sutra all over Hōichi’s body so that the ghosts would not be able to see him. They could still hear him, so the priest warned Hōichi not to make any sound.\n\nThe samurai returned the next evening. He called out to Hōichi, but Hōichi remained silent. The ghost called out again. “Why do you not answer? I see your biwa, so I know you are there.” Hōichi heard the heavy boots and grumbling of the ghost as it searched his room. “Ah, now I see why you do not answer. Your mouth and body have been taken away. Only your ears remain! Well then, I will take the ears to my lord as proof that I did everything I could.” The ghost took hold of Hōichi’s ears and tore them right off body. Hot blood poured down the sides of Hōichi’s face and body, but he did not cry out. The ghost left, taking Hōichi’s ears with him.\n\nIn the morning, the temple servants found Hōichi lying unconscious in a pool of blood. When they saw what had happened, the high priest realized his mistake. He had painted the sutra all over Hōichi, except for on his ears. Thus Hōichi’s ears remained visible to the ghost. He apologized to Hōichi and tended to his wounds. The ghosts never returned. Hōichi was saved, his story traveled far and wide, and he grew more famous than ever. People came from all around to hear the earless biwa master whose music had the power to make ghosts cry.\n\n",

In many ways it resembles an old fashioned Japanese bridal procession, in which the bride would travel to her new home among a parade of paper lanterns. Such weddings usually take place during the deep quiet of night, where they appear as a long string of kitsunebi–phantom lights–stretching over a large area.\n\nOrigin: Kitsune no yomeiri is a common phrase referring to a sun shower. When rain falls while the sun is shining, it was said to be a kitsune trick. Kitsune create rain during their weddings so that humans don’t go into the mountains and spy upon their ceremonies. Thus, whenever there was a sun shower, people believed that kitsune were having a wedding nearby.\n\nLegends: A folktale from Miyazaki Prefecture describes a kitsune no yomeiri. A man was traveling along a road in the woods, when all of a sudden a sun shower began. “A kitsune must be getting married!” thought the man. Suddenly, he spied a beautiful woman ahead of him on the road. She turned back and smiled in his direction. He followed her as she walked, and every time she turned and smiled he felt his heart flutter.\n\nThe woman entered a grove of trees. She broke a few branches and slid them into her hair, and they turned into beautiful hairpins. She traced her fingers along the trunk of a large tree and circled around it. As she did, her clothing transformed into a fabulous white bridal kimono. “How strange… This woman must be a kitsune!” he thought to himself as he stared in amazement.\n\nThe woman approached a bamboo grove. Countless fox-shaped faces began to emerge from the forest. They were carrying long ornate chests and a palanquin, which they brought up to the bride for her to enter. Each of the guests was wearing a splendid kimono decorated with their family crests. “I was right! It’s a kitsune wedding!” The man was excited to witness something so rare.\n\nThe man followed the procession for a long time, deeper and deeper into the mountains. Finally, it arrived at a large manor with a straw roof. The kitsune all entered the manor. “This must be where the ceremony will take place!” thought the man. He searched around for a place from which he could spy on the ceremony. He found a small hole high up in the wall. The man climbed upon a large stone step and stretched his legs to reach the hole. From there he could see the whole interior. The inside of the manor was decorated with expensive dining tables. A kitsune was seated at each one, and the ceremony began. “It’s just like a human wedding!” the man thought to himself.\n\nAfter watching for some time, the man grew tired and stepped down off from the peephole. He lit his pipe and had a smoke. As he puffed away on his pipe, the scenery changed before his eyes. What was a great straw-thatched manor just a moment ago was now a wooden shrine. What he thought was a stone stair was the pedestal of a great stone lantern. And the hole he peeked through was the round hole of the lantern. The guests were all gone. Even though he knew they were kitsune, he had still been bewitched by their magic.\n\n",

She brutally murdered her husband’s mistress, and in turn fell victim to the curse of the mistress’ vengeful ghost, and her own karma.\n\nLegends: Kakehashi was the beloved wife of the samurai Karakoto Urazaemon. Kakehashi was unable to become pregnant, so Urazaemon kept a mistress named Monohana. Kakehashi and Monohana got along very well. But while Urazaemon was away on business, his neighbor Furutori Sabunta plotted against him. He laid a trap for Kakehashi. Toying with her emotions, Sabunta made Kakehashi believe that Urazaemon and Monohana were planning to murder her. He showed her letters from her husband to his mistress describing their plan. Then Sabunta seduced Kakehashi. He convinced her to kidnap and torture Monohana, then finally drown her in a goldfish tank. Afterwards, they stole Urazaemon’s valuables, ran off into the mountains together.\n\nKakehashi and Sabunta ran into a gang of bandits, who stripped them of all of their stolen goods. Penniless and wanted for murder, Kakehashi and Sabunta had no choice but to hide away in the mountains. They survived by becoming bandits themselves. Sabunta dressed up as a yuki onna, scaring and robbing travelers in the snowy mountain pass. He amassed a large amount of wealth, and eventually became a powerful bandit leader himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Kakehashi was tormented by the spirit of Monohana. She suffered terrible dreams in which she was attacked by countless goldfish which bit her all over. When she woke up, she was covered in painful bruises in all of the places she dreamed the goldfish had bit her. Kakehashi put ointment on the wounds, but it only caused the pain to increase. Eventually, the pain was so great that she became bedridden.\n\nKakehashi’s symptoms worsened day by day. Her face began to swell. Pustules erupted all over her body. Her skin split, and became streaked with rivers of pus and blood. The pain and the itching were unbearable. The stench was nauseating. As her symptoms worsened, her cheeks inflated like balloons. Her lips and nose rotted and fell of, permanently exposing her teeth. Her inflamed eyes pushed out of their sockets.\n\nKakehashi could no longer swallow food, and began to starve. She could barely drink water, and even that caused her great pain. Her belly became distended like a taiko drum. Her arms and hands shriveled up until they looked like skin and bone. She now looked like a giant, grotesque goldfish. No doctors were able to diagnose her illness, but Kakehashi knew that it was the curse of Monohana’s ghost.\n\nConsumed by suffering, Kakehashi lashed out at Sabunta. “You brought this curse upon me! You turned me into an adulteress. You made me kick Monohana’s pregnant belly until it split open. You made me kill her unborn child! Don’t think I will ever forget it!” Kakehashi’s pain caused her mind to snap. She alternated between spitting curses at Sabunta, and cuddling her pillow like a child, singing lullabies to it.\n\nIf Kakehashi wished for death, Monohana’s curse did not grant it to her. Letting Kakehashi die would be too merciful. Monohana wanted her to suffer. And so Kakehashi slowly recover from her illness. But while her pain and her insanity gradually subsided, but her physical deformities never healed. She was cursed to look like a monster for the rest of her life. After that, Sabunta returned home less and less often. Kakehashi became increasingly jealous. She was terrified that Sabunta would leave her because of her disfigurement.\n\nOne day, after Sabunta had not returned for several days, Kakehashi grew tired of waiting. She went looking for him herself. She found him drinking sake in his camp, with his arms around a pair of beautiful young women. Kakehashi was furious. She stormed over and grabbed both women by the hair and snarled at Sabunta, “Wherever you hide, don’t think I won’t find you!”\n\nWithout hesitation, Sabuta drew his sword to Kakehashi’s neck. He revealed the truth to her: “Everything I said to you was a lie. Your husband never betrayed you; I forged those letters just to manipulate you. I never loved you, I just used you to get Urazaemon’s money. You are the one who killed Monohana. How dare you begrudge me for your sins! Everything that happened to you is your fault, because you were dumb enough to believe my lies!”\n\nKakehashi regretted everything she had done to her husband and to Monohana, but it only fueled her rage. Her eyes flared with anger. Her fangs snapped in her lipless mouth. Her long hair flew about wildly. Gripping the two girls by their hair, she screamed. “If you kill me, I will find you. Alive or dead I will find you. I will hunt you down you across the six realms and the four directions. And I will have my revenge.” Sabunta laughed. Holding his sake in one hand and his sword in the other, he mocked Kakehashi. Then he cut Kakehashi’s head from her body.\n\nSuddenly the sky grew dark. A gust of wind blew and the earth began to shake. Kakehashi’s severed head shot up into the sky. Her eyes burned white-hot and stared at Sabunta. Flames leapt from her mouth. The screaming head spiraled around him in circles. And then, it suddenly vanished. Sabunta looked back at Kakehashi’s body. Her dead hands were still gripping the hair of the two girls. Sabunta cut her arms from her body to free the girls, but it was two late. They were both dead.\n\nFrom then on, Sabunta was haunted by Kakehashi’s vengeful ghost. Everywhere he went, Kakehashi found him and tortured him relentlessly. She inflicted him with sickness and madness, and like Kakehashi his disease left him disfigured. And just as Monohana had done to her, Kakehashi never killed Sabunta. It was Urazaemon’s brother Takijiro who eventually tracked Sabunta down and took revenge upon him.\n\n",

If a ship got too close to an akaei as it surfaced or sank, the ship was almost certain to be destroyed in a great wave, or sucked down to the bottom of the sea in a whirlpool.\n\nOrigin: Akaei’s description comes from Ehon hyakumonogatari, a picture book of strange tales published in 1841.\n\nLegends: A ship departing from Awa (today the southern tip of Chiba Prefecture) was blown off course during a typhoon. Although the sailors survived, the ship was heavily damaged and they needed to find repairs. After the storm had passed, the sailors spotted a island. They made for it, hoping to perform some badly needed repairs on their ship. When the sailors set foot upon the island, they were surprised to find no humans anywhere. Even stranger, the trees and bushes growing on the island were like none they had ever seen before, and their branches were covered in algae. All of the cracks and crevices in the island’s rocks contained pools full of different kinds of fish.\n\nThe sailors marched around the island for hours, covering many kilometers. They found no trace of buildings or people anywhere. When they tried to slake their thirst in one of the many ponds, they discovered that every bit of water on the island was salty. Eventually, they gave up any hope of finding repairs on the island. They returned to their battered ship to seek help elsewhere.\n\nNo sooner did the sailors depart the island, when it sunk straight down into the sea. The sailors didn’t realize it at the time, but they had been walking on the back of an akaei.\n\n",

Alongside the illustration was recorded its name and legend. Its name likely originated from from a nearby lake called Kamiike.\n\nIn 1858, a major outbreak of cholera appeared in Japan. It originated in Nagasaki and spread along the highways to the rest of the country, reaching Numazu in the late summer. An estimated thirty- to forty-thousand people perished.

It spoke to observers, and predicted a coming bumper crop. It also said that an outbreak of cholera would appear, and that people without virtue would die in three days.

When viewed from above, they appear to have the scowling face of a samurai mask imprinted on their carapace. According to legend, this the result of the enmity of drowned samurai from the Taira clan–also known as the Heike–imprinting itself on these crabs.\n\nOrigin: During the twelfth century, a bloody civil war was fought between Japan’s two most important political clans—the Minamoto, or Genji, and the Taira, or Heike. The war was decisively ended in 1185 at the Battle of Dan no ura. The Genji and Heike fleets met at the narrow strait separating Honshū and Kyūshū. While the battle initially favored the Heike, as the tides changed the advantaged went to the Genji. On top of that, a Taira general defected and revealed the location of the Heike ship carrying the six year old Emperor Antoku and the imperial regalia. Genji archers rained arrows down upon the Heike fleet. When it became clear that defeat was inevitable, the surviving Heike, including the young emperor, flung themselves into the sea to drown rather than be captured. The battle resulted in a decisive victory for the Genji and the complete destruction of the Heike.\n\nLegends: Although the Heike were physically exterminated, their souls lived on, carrying the grudge from the war and the betrayal of their general. The souls of the dead Heike warriors lost at sea became lodged in the crabs crawling on the bottom of the sea. The crabs’ shells mutated into the shape of a scowling face, a permanent reminder of the never ending grudge of the Heike.\n\nIn Kitakyūshū City, it is said that the souls of the Heike men turned into heikegani, while the souls of the Heike women turned into kappa.\n\n",

They are found in sacred freshwater lakes and ponds.\n\nOrigin: A legend of a teruto uo from Izumo Province was recorded by Englishman Richard Gordan Smith during his travels through Japan.\n\nLegends: In 1646, a man named Ōtani Jinnai and his wife Oryō lived in Matsue, Izumo Province. Although they tried for many years, they were unable to have children. They visited many shrines and temples to beg the gods and buddhas to grant them a child. They heard that the gods of the Ōkamiyama Shrine on Mount Daisen had a miraculous effect on couples wishing to conceive, and so Jinnai and Oryō climbed Mount Daisen to ask for the gods’ favor.\n\nAs they descended the mountain, the air began to grow foggy. Around Akamatsu Pound, they could no longer see where they were headed and had to wait. A beautiful woman emerged from the mists and asked them what they were doing. When they explained their reasons to the woman, she produced a bottle of water from her robes. She told them it was holy water collected from the drew drops on the grass around Akamatsu Pond and offered to the gods of the Ōkamiyama Shrine on New Years Day. She said that if Oryō drank it, she would surely be blessed with a child. Oryō eagerly drank the water. It made her head spin as if she was drunk, but within moments she felt different. She felt that she was with child. A moment later, the fog had cleared away, and the beautiful woman was nowhere in sight.\n\nThe following year Oryō gave birth to a beautiful girl they named Ochiyo. Jinnai and Oryō loved her dearly. They told her all about how she was a blessing from the gods of Mount Daisen and Akamatsu Pond. The three of them lived happily together, and eventually Ochiyo grew into a lovely young woman.\n\nWhen Ochiyo was sixteen years old, she was promised in marriage to a young man that Jinnai chose. Ochiyo did not love her intended or want to marry him, but she also did not want to betray the wish of her parents. She did not argue with her parents’ selection, but before the wedding was to occur she asked her parents to allow her to make a pilgrimage to Ōkamiyama Shrine to report her marriage to the gods who gave her life. They agreed, and sent her nanny Osuma to accompany Ochiyo on the journey to Mount Daisen.\n\nOchiyo wore her finest kimono, and with Osuma by her side she traveled to the summit of Mount Daisen and gave prayers to the gods. On the way down from the mountain, she crossed the same location where her parents had encountered the strange and beautiful girl who gave them the holy water. Ochiyo approached the edge of the pond and stared into it. Suddenly, a thick mist poured off of the pond’s surface and surrounded Ochiyo.\n\nOchiyo seemed to ponder something in the mist. She turned to Osuma, then thanked her and said goodbye. “I was born into this world as a human, but this is only a temporary form. I am actually a fish, and this pond is my real home.” She gave Osuma a letter to deliver to her parents, and then she dove into the pond. Osuma screamed and begged Ochiyo to come back. Then, a giant carp with shining, golden scales splashed around in the lake and looked up at Osuma. Its face was unmistakably the face of Ochiyo.\n\nOsuma returned to Matsue. She told Jinnai and Oryō what had happened, and they were overcome with sadness. Osuma deliverd Ochiyo’s final letter to her parents. In it, Ochiyo thanked her parents for everything, and explained that because she was a teruto uo, she could not marry a human. Finally, she told them that if they ever wanted to see her again, all they had to do was come to the bank of Akamatsu Pond and call her name. Although it was difficult, Jinnai and Oryō accepted their daughter’s confession. They were thankful to the gods of Mount Daisen for giving them a lovely daughter. Jinnai built a shrine in honor of the teruto uo and entrusted Ochiyo’s letter to it.\n\nSome time later, Jinnai and Oryō and their relatives traveled to Akamatsu Pond. They gathered at the water’s edge and called out, “Teruto uo!” From the depths of the pond came a thunderous roar as if in response. However, they never saw Ochiyo or the teruto uo again.\n\nSince then, many travelers have come to Akamatsu Pond on Mount Daisen in order call out teruto uo’s name. And Jinnai’s shrine became a popular destination for couples and single people to pray to the gods for love.\n\n",

He was a chief retainer to the lord of Matsue. Tanomo and his wife longed for a child, but for many years they were unable. One day he heard that the god of Akamatsu Pond on Mount Daisen could grant wishes. He climbed the mountain to visit the pond and prayed to the gods for a child.\n\nSure enough, the Matsuura family was soon blessed with a daughter. They named her Ohatsu. She was well loved by her family and their servants. As she grew, stories of her stunning beauty traveled far and wide. Eventually she caught the eye of Lord Matsudaira Kō, who desired her for his bride. Ohatsu did not wish to be married, but there was no way a retainer like her father could turn down a lord’s request. So Ohatsu’s parents prepared to send her away to the castle. Before she left to become a bride, Ohatsu asked to visit Akamatsu Pond to give thanks to the god who granted her life. Her parents naturally agreed.\n\nOhatsu climbed Mount Daisen with an escort of her family’s servants and guards. They arrived at Akamatsu Pond. Its surface was like a mirror, reflecting the clear sky and verdant mountains surrounding it. Ohatsu’s servants suggested that she wash her hair in the beautiful pond; its water would surely make her hair even more beautiful for her lord. Ohatsu dipped her hair into the water and began combing it. With each stroke of the comb, her hair grew longer, as if creeping towards the water’s edge. Then Ohatsu stood up and stepped out onto pond, walking on the surface of the water. Her servants called out to her, but she did not turn back. When she reached the center of the pond, a whirlpool churned beneath her and she sank down into the depths.\n\nThe servants panicked. They called out to the pond and begged Ohatsu to come back. A whirlpool once again opened up in the center of the pond. Ohatsu reemerged from the maelstrom, but from her waist down she appeared to be a giant serpent. She spoke to her servants: “I am a serpent who lives in this pond. When Tanomo came to me and begged for a child, his wish was so sincere that I decided to become Ohatsu and live a human life for some time. But that time is over now, and I must return to my pond. Thank you, everyone, for raising me and caring for me these many years. From here on, I will give happiness and fortune to all who come to pray for me.” Then, she sank beneath the surface of the water and was never seen again.\n\nA small stone shrine was built for Ohatsu besides the pond. She is worshiped there as the dragon god of Akamatsu Pond, and is said to grant wishes to pilgrims and protect the local villages against drought. Her festival is held every year on Mount Daisen on June 18th–the day that she returned to her serpent form.\n\nAnd in the Matsuura house in Matsue City, every year on June 18th they would remember Ohatsu by raising eight folding screens around a water basin in their banquet hall. The sand found in the bottom of the water basin the next day was proof that Ohatsu had visited.\n\n",

They lurk underwater in the shade of structures like bridges or watermills and wait for young men to venture close to the water. They leap out of the river and land on a bridge or a riverbank.

When a kawahime is nearby, young men are told to keep their gaze pointed towards the ground, hold their breath, and walk away as quickly as possible.\n\nOrigin: Kawahime may originate from ancient superstitions about outsiders. Long ago, when everyone in a village knew each other, it was rare to leave your home town. It would have been very suspicious to encounter a lone, unknown woman along a riverbank. If she were from a neighboring village, a young man would be courting trouble from her relatives by needless socializing with her. Cautionary tales about the dangers of unknown women and yōkai lurking at the outskirts of villages may have been invented to avoid strife with neighboring villages and help reinforce a community’s bonds.\n\nMore recent depictions of kawahime often give her kappa-like features, such as reptilian skin or webbed hands and feet.\n\nLegends: A young man was traveling through a valley on his way to visit a friend. Near the riverside, he came upon upon a lone, beautiful woman coiling a spool of thread. The man found this suspicious. He thought she must be some kind of bakemono. He threatened the woman, but she only responded with a creepy laugh. To see if she really was a yōkai, he drew his sword and slashed at her thread in two. The woman cackled and dove into the river.\n\nThe young man finally arrived at his friend’s home. When he told his friend what had happened, his friend warned him that the sword which cut her thread will have lost its ability to cut. He lent him a different sword for the journey home.\n\nWhen the young man returned home, he passed through the same valley. The suspicious woman was waiting for him by the riverside. She challenged him saying, “Your sword which cut my thread cannot harm me!” However, the young man was carrying his friend’s sword. He cut the woman down, slaying her. That woman was actually a kawahime.\n\n",

It is depicted in a number of different ways by different artists, but in most depictions it has long, flowing hair, big, buggy eyes, and a beak-like mouth. Some paintings portray it more bird-like, while others portray it in as a grotesque, misshapen goblin-like creature. It’s most identifying feature is the large mallet it carries. It is usually portrayed holding the mallet over its head, ready to strike another yōkai.\n\nOrigin: A mallet-weilding yōkai appears in many of the earliest picture scrolls of the night parade of one hundred demons. In its oldest depictions, kanazuchibō appears with no name or description. Names like kanazuchibō and daichiuchi were added much later, during the Edo period. However no description of its behavior were ever recorded. Many artists and yōkai scholars have made guesses at its true nature.\n\nIt has been suggested that kanazuchibō may be a spirit of cowardice.  His posture and his hammer evoke the proverbs “to strike a stone bridge before crossing” (meaning to be excessively careful before doing anything) and “like a hammer in the water” (meaning to always be looking at the ground and watching your step; picture a hammer in a river, with its heavy head sinking below the surface, but its wooden handle floating upright). Perhaps this is a yōkai which haunts cowards, or which turns people into cowards when it haunts them.\n\nKanazuchibō is also known as ōari, or giant ant. In prehistoric Japan there was a culture which built large earthen burial mounds known as kofun. It has been suggested that in the Kofun people’s religion, ants were revered as divine creatures since they build earthen mounds. As the Kofun religion died out, those creatures formerly worshiped as kami grew resentful and warped into these ant-like yōkai. While it’s an amusing story, there’s no evidence to suggest the Kofun people actually worshipped ants. This explanation was almost certainly made up by modern storytellers.\n\nToriyama Sekien included a version of this yōkai in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. He re-imagined it as a tsukumogami born from a keyari—a hairy spear used as decoration and in parades. He named it yarikechō, or “spear hair chief.”\n\n",

It is usually depicted as a round, bright red creature with big eyes, two clawed feet, and a diminutive tail. There are many variations of this yokai, with minor difference in color, number of appendages, facial features, and hair.\n\nOrigin: Okka appears in many of the oldest yōkai picture scrolls. Since its original name was never recorded, countless names have been used to describe this yōkai. The word okka is a baby talk variation of obake, a generic word for a ghost or monster. It fits this yōkai quite well, as okka itself has a somewhat generic and baby-like appearance. It also fits an established pattern of monsters being named in baby talk; waira, otoroshi, gagoze, and uwan are also thought to be “baby-fied” variations of scary words.\n\nIt has been suggested that okka may be a frog spirit, based on its appearance. It has also been suggested that okka is a tsukumogami, as it appears alongside other tsukumogami in paintings. Though it was never given a name or an explanation, okka has yet remained a common sight in scrolls depicting the night parade of one hundred demons. Okka is frequently depicted together with kanazuchibō; it appears to be the target of kanazuchibō’s hammer. However, their frequent pairing may be no more than a coincidence. Painters frequently copied directly from earlier yōkai scrolls, and without any description there is no way of knowing if the original painting that depicts okka being targeted by kanazuchibō was done so for a specific reason, or just because it looked amusing.\n\n",

They roam the open sea, riding in washtub boats. On the 24th night of the 1st month of the old lunar calendar, kainan hōshi come to shore and visit the villages of the Izu Islands. Anyone unfortunate enough to witness them is doomed die.\n\nInteractions: On the Izu Islands, the 24th day of the 1st month is a day of ritual fasting. People do not go to work, and you must stay indoors and remain silent all day. Going outside even to use the outhouse is forbidden–before modern plumbing was invented, villagers would prepare bottles and pots for that purpose. In case you have no choice but to go outside, you should place fragrant leaves in your hair or put a bag over your head. By all means you must never look in the direction of the ocean.\n\nTraditions vary from island to island. In general, on the night of the 24th the kainan hōshi come ashore. Residents plug up the cracks of their doors and shutters with the fragrant leaves of false holly (Osmanthus heterophyllus) and mock orange (Pittosporum tobira). The following day, the sprigs are ceremonially burned. If they make loud noises while burning, it is a signal that the year’s harvest will be bountiful. On Miyake Island they travel from house to house and chant, “Give us dishes, give us pots, or else give us a human child!” Miyake Islanders place dishes in front of their houses and put their kids to bed early on the night of the 24th.\n\nOn Izu Ōshima these spirits are called Hiimisama and worshipped at a local shrine. A single family is tasked with receiving the Hiimisama as guests. One family member spends the night alone on the beach. There, exposed to the elements, they await the Hiimisama’s coming, welcome them, and see that they leave safely.\n\nPeople who refuse to follow these superstitions soon meet with disaster. Those who fail to put leaves in their door cracks, or who open their doors during this period may lose the ability to speak, or contract psychological illnesses requiring hospitalization. People foolish enough to venture outside have returned home covered in blood, unable to explain what happened to them. Anyone who catches a glimpse of the kainan hōshi will die.\n\nOrigin: Kainan hōshi originate in an incident that took place in 1628. The governor of Hachijō Island, Toyoshima Tadamatsu, was a wicked lord who was hated by the islanders he ruled over. His subjects conspired to murder him. In one version of the story, the islanders convinced Tadamatsu to perform his routine tour of the islands during a time when the sea was roughest. On the 24th day of the 1st month, a storm came down upon Tadamatsu’s boat, and he was lost at sea. Tadamatsu’s vengeful spirit became an onryō. Ever since then, on the anniversary of his death, the ghost of Tadamatsu performs its island tour, seeking vengeance on the treacherous islanders who tricked him.\n\nAnother version of the legend says that kainan hōshi are the spirits of twenty five islanders who conspired against Tadamatsu. They murdered him on a dark and stormy night. Afterwards, they escaped into the rough seas riding in wooden washbasins. The conspirators sailed from island to island, but no villagers were willing to give them shelter. And so they were forced to roam the sea, until a storm on the 24th day of the 1st month capsized their ship and they all drowned. Their spirits became onryō. Every year on the anniversary of their deaths, they sail from island to island, cursing the faithless islanders who refused to shelter them.\n\nKainan hōshi share a number of similarities with funa yūrei, umi bōzu, and other seaborn ghosts. However, the superstitions and customs surrounding kainan hōshi suggest a connection with mikari baba, namahage, and other spirits classified as raihōjin–gods who visit during New Year’s. The dates, ritual purification, decoration of entrances, and receiving of potentially dangerous spirits as guests are features shared by a number of local traditions across Japan.\n\n",

They look like humans, although they have a uniquely odd behavior.\n\nInteractions: Ringo no kai appear in the evenings at houses near where they are planted. They ask the residents to feed them poop. If the residents cooperate, the ringo no kai eats it up with gusto, exclaiming over and over how delicious it is. Then, the ringo no kai presents its own stool to the residents of the house and demands that they partake as well.\n\nOrigin: Ringo no kai come from the folklore of Akita Prefecture, but similar stories are found in other prefectures with other kinds of fruit. Tantan kororin from neighboring Miyagi Prefecture is another well known scatological fruit yōkai.\n\nLegends: Long ago, near the village of Kakunodate, an elderly man lived all alone. One evening, a strange man came to his house. The visitor asked the elderly man to feed him poop. The man was shocked at such an unusual request, but the stranger repeated the request over and over, even begging to be fed feces. Eventually, the old man relented. He brought his guest plateful of excrement, which was devoured with gusto. The visitor exclaimed over and over again, “How delicious!”\n\nWhen he was finished eating, the visitor got up as if to leave. But instead, he reached behind his back and excreted a hot, steaming pile of feces into his hands and presented it to the old man. “Here, try this!” he demanded. The old man was at a loss for words, but the stranger kept insisting, until finally the old man sampled the excrement.\n\nIt was the most delicious thing he had ever tasted. The old man screamed with delight as he gobbled down the stranger’s poop.\n\nFrom them on, night after night, the strange man appeared at the elderly man’s house and they feasted on each other’s dung. But eventually, the old man began to think that, no matter how delicious his guest’s poop was, the situation was incredibly suspicious. So one night as the visitor was leaving, the man grabbed a nearby cleaver and swung it at the stranger. The cleaver carved into his back and he let out a scream. Then he ran out of the house into the night.\n\nWhen morning came, the old man went outside and followed the stranger’s footprints. The led around his house to the back garden, all the way up to an old apple tree. The tree’s trunk had a hideous gash from the cleaver carved into it. The stranger had been the spirit of the apple tree all along, and the poop that the old man had been feasting upon was the unpicked apples that had begun to rot on its branches.\n\n",

They are roughly human-like in appearance, though their size, strength, and numerous appendages distinguish them from mere mortals.\n\nBehavior: Ashura are warriors above all else, and live for battle. They love combat, war, and destroying things. They have enormous egos; ashura always desire to be better than others, have no patience for those weaker than they are, and prefer to solve any problem with violence.\n\nThere are many different kinds of ashura. Some are considered to be gods and others demons. Ashura are strong, powerful, and magical. In many ways they are far superior to humans. They experience more pleasure than those in the human realm, and live much longer. However, they are controlled by such intense passions—wrath, pride, violence, and greed—that despite their pleasure-filled existence they are constantly fighting and never at peace. Ashura are also wracked with jealousy; to be reborn as an ashura means to be constantly reminded how much better life would have been if you had been reborn in a heavenly realm instead of Ashuradō.\n\nOrigin: In Japanese Buddhism, after someone dies, they are eventually reborn in one of the 6 Buddhist realms: Tendō, the realm of heaven; Ningendō, the realm of humans; Ashuradō, the realm of ashura, Chikushōdō, the realm of animals; Gakidō, the realm of hungry ghosts; and Jigokudō, the realm of hell. Of these, only two realms are considered to be “happy” rebirths—the heavenly realm and the human realm. Of the remaining realms, the realm of Jigoku is the worst, followed by Gakidō. The realm of animals is not a good rebirth because animals are ruled by their desires and thus cannot obtain enlightenment. Ashuradō, the realm of the ashura, is the least unpleasant of the “unhappy” rebirths.\n\nIn some Buddhist traditions, the realm of ashura is considered to be the lowest level of heaven, and gets included among the “happy” rebirths. However, because ashura are so controlled by their emotions, it is almost impossible for them to achieve enlightenment, become buddhas, and escape the cycle of endless reincarnation. Souls who are reborn here are usually humans who lived good lives up to a point, but committed some wicked deed which prevents them from being reborn in the realm of heaven.\n\n",

They have large feathery tails. They crow like roosters. Often times a crowing chicken’s head can even be seen protruding from their mouths.\n\nOrigin: Buddhist monks were expected to live austere lives. They woke before dawn to practice chanting. They spent their mornings copying scripture and meditating. They spent their afternoons begging for alms in the villages. One of the most important rules that monks had to live by was to never take a life. As part of this rule they were forbidden from eating meat. Of course, this did not necessarily mean that every monk was a strict vegetarian. Sinful clergy and their supernatural punishment is a common theme among yōkai folklore.\n\nNiwatori no sō is the result of one such punishment. It originates from the vengeful spirits of chickens who were eaten. The chicken’s grudge-curse serves as evidence of a sin that may have otherwise gone unpunished—in this case, the sin of stealing, killing, and eating a chicken.\n\nLegends: One of the earliest accounts of niwatori no sō is found in an 18th century illustrated book of yōkai tales called Ehon yōkai kidan by Okada Gyokuzan. A monk stole a chicken from a neighbor’s yard and ate it. When his neighbor noticed that one of his chickens was missing, he questioned the monk. The monk grew outraged. He pointed out his shaved head. He pointed out his monk’s robes. He said that no monk would ever stoop to something like stealing, let alone eating a chicken. He lectured his neighbor about compassion and charity. But as he spoke, suddenly from his throat came a loud “cockadooledoo!” An instant later, a chicken’s head erupted from his mouth, and a feathery tail sprouted from his back. The monk transformed into a chicken monster, and his crime was exposed.\n\n",

This phenomenon is known all over Japan, with countless variations on the same theme. It usually takes place in a specific stall in a specific bathroom in the school. Usually it is an older or seldom used bathroom, often in a stall with an older style squat toilet.  Often the fourth stall is the cursed one, as the number four is associated with death.\n\nMost stories follow this general pattern: while at school late in the evening, a student suddenly finds him or herself in desperate need of a toilet. The closest restroom available is one that is normally avoided by the students; it is older and less well-kept, separated from the rest of the school, and is rumored to be haunted. But with no time to search for a different restroom, the student enters. He or she does their business, and when they have finished, they reach for the toilet paper only to find that there is none. Then they hear a strange voice: “Do you want red paper? Or blue paper?” The student answers, “Red paper,” and a moment later is stabbed and sliced up so violently that blood sprays everywhere, soaking their body and making it look as if they were wearing a bright red cloak. Some time later, another student finds him or herself in need of a toilet in a similar situation. They know the rumors that a student died in the restroom, but they have no choice and use the bathroom anyway. Sure enough, a voice asks them, “Red paper or blue paper?” Remembering the legend, this student says, “Blue paper.” Then, all of the student’s blood is sucked out of their body, leaving them dead and blue-faced on the floor.\n\nPlenty of variations of this legend exist, each with minor differences. The true identity of Aka manto is one of these. Sometimes it is said to be a person hiding in the adjacent stall—a serial killer in many stories. Other times it is a ghost who appears as a tall man with a sickly, bluish-white face. In some places it is even blamed on a hairy yōkai called a kainade who lives in the toilet and likes to stroke people’s rear ends with its hand. In the kainade’s case, the end result is markedly less violent: a hairy arm of the chosen color rises out of the toilet to stroke the student’s behind.\n\nIn some cases, instead of draining your blood, “blue paper” gets you strangled until your face turns blue. Sometimes answering “red paper” gets your skin flayed so that it hangs off of your back like a red cape (a play on the “aka manto” name). In other versions, instead of being killed, the student’s skin color will change permantly to whatever color he or she chose. Sometimes those who survive and tell the story to others fall terribly ill and die shortly after. And sometimes the consequences are worse than death, such as being dragged into the netherworld, never to be seen again.\n\nThe questions have many variations as well, including “red vest or blue vest,” “red hand or blue hand,” or “red tongue or blue tongue.” Sometimes the colors are red or white, instead of blue. When the choices are red or white paper, red often results in a red tongue rising up out of the toilet to lick the student’s rear end, while white results in a white hand rising up to stroke the student’s rear end. Less common choices are red paper or purple paper: choosing purple allows the student to escape unharmed, while choosing red causes the student to be pulled down through the toilet into the plumbing.\n\nAs with many urban legends, there is usually no escape from your horrible fate—though that doesn’t stop people from trying. Clever students who bring extra toilet paper with them discover that it vanishes before they are able to use it, and still find themselves having to answer to Aka manto. People who choose a different color other than those offered in hopes to confuse the spirit are met with an equally horrible death (one common version has a student say “yellow paper,” and the result is that their face is pushed down into the dirty toilet water and held there until they drown). In some instances, students have been able to escape by saying “I don’t need any paper,” buying them just enough time to run out of the bathroom before anything happens.\n\nOrigin: Tracing the origin of urban legends can be difficult. Aka manto is fairly old as far as urban legends go. It is recorded as a popular schoolyard rumor as early as the 1930’s, and its popularity hasn’t faded even as newer toilet legends (such as Toire no Hanako-san) have come into existence. One explanation for Aka manto’s origin and continued popularity is in its nature. It may be a reflection of the anxiety inherent in being a student. Aka manto asks children an impossible question to which any answer results in something terrible. That feeling is not too different from having to answer a difficult problem on a test, or a teacher’s question in front of the whole classroom when you don’t know the answer.\n\nAka manto’s appearance has changed over time along with the Japanese lexicon. Today, manto is the Japanese word for a cloak or a cape, and so aka manto is usually depicted wearing a long red hooded cloak. However, in the 1930’s when this urban legend was born, manto referred to a shorter, sleeveless kimono jacket. As a result, different generations have different visual impressions of what Aka manto looks like.\n\n",

They look like other tengu–vaguely birdlike, with dark feathers. They usually remain invisible to humans, but are sometimes spotted on cloudy or rainy days wearing beautiful kimono and carrying umbrellas.\n\nBehavior: Kawa tengu spend their days alone on the riverside, sitting on the rocks and watching the water as if deep in thought. At night they catch fish. They create magical fireballs called tengubi which float above the water and act like lures. They are fond of creating auditory hallucinations, and are more often heard than seen. The sound of nonexistent rapids or waterfalls coming from valleys is often the work of kawa tengu.\n\nInteractions: Kawa tengu enjoy playing pranks on humans, but rarely do any real harm. They use magic to scare people away if they get too close. If a fisherman casts his net near where a kawa tengu is fishing, it will create illusionary torchlights and the sounds of crowds of people to draw them away. If children play too close to where a kawa tengu is sitting, it will scare them away with illusions–for example, a giant, black monk emerging from the forest chanting, “Children, children!”\n\nIf a person purposefully goes looking for a kawa tengu, the pranks can become more direct. Someone leaning over a riverbank looking for a kawa tengu will suddenly lose their footing and stumble head-over-heels into the river. They also create illusory bridges, causing people who try to cross them to tumble and suffer injuries.\n\nSome villagers leave offerings of freshly caught fish by the riverside, or wash the large boulders along the banks. After doing this, the kawa tengu leave them alone.\n\nLegends: Along the Tama River in western Tōkyō, there was a kawa tengu who could be seen every day sitting by a deep pool, lost in contemplation. One spring, however, he mysteriously vanished. In the fall of that year, the kawa tengu returned to his rock, although now he was accompanied by a beautiful young female tengu. A villager offered the pair a nice bowl and tray set as a wedding gift, and the tengu thanked them by teaching them how to make an effective fever medication from worms.\n\nA fisherman was walking along the Tama River, returning home after a day’s work. His pack was filled to the brim with fish. Suddenly he heard a strange sound like a person splashing in the water behind him. He put down his heavy pack to investigate. There was nobody there. After deciding he must have been hearing things, the fisherman shouldered his pack and continued on his way, but it was much lighter than it had been a moment ago. He looked inside, and all of the fish were gone. He had caught so many fish that he angered a kawa tengu, who took them all back.\n\n",

Their breath appears rainbow colored when they exhale. They sometimes carry spears which they use to assault humans. Like many animal yōkai, ōgama have the ability to change their forms and disguise themselves as humans.\n\nBehavior: When a Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus) reaches one thousand years of age, it transforms into an ōgama. Ōgama behave for the most part like they did when they were ordinary toads. They live deep in the mountains, usually by rivers. They hunt bugs, birds, and snakes by breathing their rainbow-colored breathe on them, and then snatching them up with their powerful, stretchy tongues.\n\nInteractions: Ōgama rarely come into contact with humans due to their remote habitat, but it does occasionally happen. When they rest, they are large enough that they can be mistaken for a large boulder or other natural mass, and a foolish person might accidentally sit on them. Even the smallest ōgama will commit evil deeds. When provoked, they are clever enough to wield spears and chase after humans. When they reach sizes of over three meters, they begin to see humans as food.\n\nOrigin: Toad legends can be found all over Japan. Ōgama appear in a number of Edo Period story collections, including Ehon hyakumonogatari and Hokuetsu kidan, but superstitions about toads go back much further. Toads living deep in the mountains tended to grow larger than those living closer to humans. This may have given rise to the idea that the deepest, most remote mountains might be home to truly gigantic toads.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Miyagi Prefecture, a famous marksman heard about an old, dilapidated house by a bridge where every night a strange old woman appeared and spun thread. Her neighbors feared her and thought she was a demon of some kind. The marksman went to investigate the old woman. Her smile and cackle were so disturbing to him that he immediately aimed his gun at her heart and fired. As he did, the light from her lantern went out and the night became pitch black. The marksman stumbled home in the dark. The following morning the woman was gone, and there was no sign of any injury. He must have missed somehow. A few nights later the old woman appeared again. The marksman went to see, and this time he aimed his gun not at the woman, but at her lantern. He fired, and once again everything went black. This time he heard a terrible shriek and a clattering sound. At first light he returned to the house, and lying where the woman had been was the corpse of an enormous, ugly toad.\n\nIn Niigata Prefecture, a man went deep into the mountains to fish in a pond. He sat down on a boulder by the water’s edge and cast his line into the water. A fisherman on the other side of the pond noticed him. Suddenly the fisherman’s face went pale. He packed up all of his gear as quickly as he could. He motioned for the man to do the same, and then he ran away. The man did as he was told, and ran off into the woods after the fisherman. When he found him, the fisherman asked him, “Didn’t you notice? The boulder you were sitting on suddenly opened a massive eye red as fire, and then it yawned!” When the two returned to the pond to see, the boulder the man had sat upon was gone without any trace. In actuality, he had been sitting on an ōgama.\n\n",

Very rarely, they are also said to take the reverse appearance: a cow’s face on a human body. They are born from cows, and their birth is often said to be an omen of some significant historical event. A kudan never lives for more than a few days.\n\nBehavior: Kudan are able to speak human languages from the day they are born. Immediately upon being born, a kudan gives one or more prophecies. The content of their prophecies varies. Some kudan have spoken of great harvests or terrible famines, some have foretold plagues and droughts, while others have predicted wars. The prediction of a kudan never fails to come true. Upon delivering its prophecy, a kudan immediately dies.\n\nOrigin: Kudan are a relatively recent yokai, having entered the public zeitgeist during the end of the Edo period. This was a period of great social and political upheaval. The fall of the shogunate and the return of imperial authority, combined with the rapid changes brought about by the opening of trade with the West were responsible for a lot of uncertainly and turmoil throughout Japan. During this time, stories of kudan being born popped up up in newspapers all across the country.\n\nKudan sightings continued through the end of the Edo period until after World War 2. Among some of the events supposedly predicted by kudan are the Russo-Japanese War and the Pacific War. Because of their uncanny ability to predict the future, the word of a kudan was viewed as absolute truth. During the Edo period, newspapers looking to add credibility to a story would include the words “kudan no gotoshi,” or, “as if a kudan had said it” to their articles. This phrase remains in use in the Japanese language today as a way of assuring the reader of the truth of a story.\n\nBecause of its reputation for honesty, images of kudan were used as talismans for good luck, prosperity, and protection from sickness and disaster. Newspapers advised their readers to hang the printed images of kudan on their houses for protection and good fortune. Kudan were such popular yokai that their mummified remains were often carted around in traveling sideshows. These “kudan” could be made of stillborn deformed calves, or of different animal parts stitched together to create a chimera-like stuffed animal. Visitors paid a small fee to gawk at these specimens and hopefully receive some of their good luck. A few of these mummified remains survive in museums today.\n\n",

Also included are the onryō of important historical figures such as Mononobe no Moriya, Emperor Sutoku, Sugawara no Michizane, and Taira no Masakado. In the case of historical figures, they are almost always ancient nobles who died in anguish and transformed into onryō.\n\nInteractions: Tatarigami wreak havoc upon those who wronged them—usually other nobles. In order to appease their vengeful spirits, shrines honoring them have been built across Japan. Through proper appeasement, their curses can be lifted, or at least abated.\n\nThe Gion Matsuri in Kyōto, one of the most famous festivals in Japan, is an example of a ceremony initially designed to appease a tatarigami. During the Heian period, Kyōto suffered a number of outbreaks which were thought to be caused by Susanoo and Gozu tennō—two powerful gods of disease and destruction. In order to appease their wrath, a festival was held in their honor at the Yasaka Shrine in Gion. To keep the city free from disease, the festival was repeated every year. Eventually the connection to Susanoo and Emperor Gozu was lost, but the festival traditions remain to this day.\n\nThe appeasement of tatarigami remained an important part of religious life throughout the Heian period and beyond. The duty of pacifying these curse spirits fell to the onmyōji, and popular belief in this superstition helped onmyōdō rise in power.\n\n",

They are described as having the beak of a rooster, the jaw of a swallow, the head of a pheasant, the neck of a snake, the back of a tortoise, the legs of a crane, and the tail of a peacock. Brilliantly colored with the five colors of the Chinese elements—white, black, red, yellow, and blue—they have five distinctive tail feathers.\n\nBehavior: Hōō are creatures of utter peace and never cause harm to other living things. They eat only bamboo seeds, and nest only in paulownia trees. When a hōō flies, it is said that the wind stops, dust settles, and birds and insects grow quiet. Because of their purity, they appear only in lands blessed with peace, prosperity, and happiness. They flee to the heavens during times of trouble. The appearance of a hōō is an extremely good omen, said to signify the beginning of a new era.\n\nInteractions: The hōō is a popular motif in Japanese paintings, crafts, kimonos, and as designs on temples and shrines. As a symbol, it represents fire, the sun, and the imperial family. It also stands for the virtues of duty, propriety, faith, and mercy. Its five colors represent the five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\n\nOrigin: Hōō come from Chinese mythology, where they are known as fenghuang. Originally they were considered to be two distinct birds: the male hō (feng) and the female ō (huang), symbolizing yin and yang and the duality of the universe. Eventually the two creatures merged into one and their combined name was used. The combined creature is still considered to be female, and is often partnered with the tatsu, which is considered to be male.\n\nThe hōō is one of the most revered and holiest animals in Japan. Second only to the kirin in terms of power, it is the most sacred bird in the Japanese pantheon.\n\n",

            "content": "平将門\nたいらのまさかどAppearance: Taira no Masakado was a samurai of the Heian period, a powerful warrior, and a great leader. He was born either in the late 800s or early 900s CE and was killed in 940. After his death, his spirit is said to have returned as a vengeful ghost and brought destruction across the country. Along with Emperor Sutoku and Sugawara no Michizane, he is one of the Nihon San Dai Onryō—Three Great Onryō of Japan.\n\nThough Taira no Masakado’s birth date is unknown, he is believed to have been born sometime around when Sugawara no Michizane died. A Meiji period biography of Taira no Masakado suggests that he may have been Sugawara no Michizane’s reincarnation; his revolt against the emperor may actually have been a continuation of Michizane’s curse.\n\nOrigin: Taira no Masakado was born into the Kanmu Heishi, the clan of Taira descended from Emperor Kanmu. It was an elite family. Masakado had a privileged childhood in the capital, after which he settled down in Shimosa Province in Eastern Japan, northeast of modern day Tokyo. His troubles only began after his father died. Inheritance laws at this time were not firmly established, and his uncles tried to steal most of his father’s land. They claimed their royal lineage gave them the right to do so.\n\nIn 935 CE, the dispute with his family members broke into outright battle. Masakado was ambushed by one of his uncles and a number of Minamoto warriors. But Masakado was a powerful warrior. He quickly defeated them, and then took his revenge by burning their lands, ravaging the countryside, and slaughtering thousands. This brought him into conflict with other relatives by blood and by marriage, who brought their dispute to the emperor.\n\nTaira no Masakado was summoned to court to answer charges of the relatives of the dead Minamoto warriors. Masakado was not only brave, he was also smart. He had taken great pains to remain within the law and proved that he had good reason for his killings. After only a few months, he was fully pardoned when the court offered a general amnesty in commemoration of Emperor Suzaku’s coming of age.\n\nTaira no Masakado returned to his home, but soon found himself under attack. This time, it was his father-in-law and his relatives. Again, Masakado quickly defeated them. To avoid stirring up more political trouble, Masakado received a warrant to apprehend his attackers. Now, with legal sanction for his military action, he stormed into their lands on a quest for revenge.\n\nIn 938 CE, Taira no Masakado received another court summons for questioning about a quarrel with one of the cousins who had attacked him. This time, Masakado ignored the summons. He raised a large force and invaded Hitachi Province. He conquered eight provinces: Shimotsuke, Kozuke, Musashi, Kazusa, Awa, Sagami, Izu, and Shimosa. The whole time, he maintained his innocence, insisting that his campaign was legal under the terms of his warrant.\n\nThe government was seen as ineffectual and the nobles as abusive by the peasants of the time. Taira no Masakado, on the other hand, treated the peasants of his conquered domains much better than their former masters did. His insurrection was seen as a salvation by many peasants. They welcomed him gladly. The court feared that Taira no Masakado was preparing to overthrow the government and declare himself the new Emperor of Japan. He was condemned as a rebel and a traitor.\n\nA number of warriors—including Masakado’s ally Fujiwara no Hidesato and some his own relatives—were commissioned by the government to take his head. They caught up with Masakado’s army in Shimosa province on the fourteenth day of the second month of 940 CE. They attacked during a night ambush and quickly defeated the rebels. Masakado’s men were outnumbered ten to one. Masakado was beheaded, betrayed by his friends and family. The head was brought back to Kyoto to be displayed in the east market as a message to would-be rebels.\n\nLegends: Strangely, Taira no Masakado’s head did not decompose. Many months after it was first displayed in the east market, it still looked as fresh as the day it was severed. The eyes had grown fiercer, and the mouth twisted up into a hideous grimace. Night after night the head would call out, “Where is my murdered body!? Come here! Reattach my head and let me fight once again!” And then things got really strange.\n\nOne night the head began to glow. It flew off into the sky, across the country, towards Shimosa. The head eventually grew tired and landed to rest in a fishing village called Shibazaki (which would one day grow into the city of Edo). The villagers who found the head cleaned it and buried it. A shrine was erected over the grave and named Kubizuka—the mound of the head. Masakado was honored and worshipped by the peasants as a true warrior, a symbol of justice who stood in heroic defiance of a corrupt and lazy nobility. He was seen as an underdog who was repeatedly betrayed and eventually murdered by those he should have been able to trust. Despite his deification and popularity among the lower classes, his ghost was not appeased. A few years after his head was buried, the ghost of a samurai began to be seen in the neighborhood of his shrine.\n\nIn the early 1300s, a great plague struck Edo. Many people died. The plague was attributed to Taira no Masakado’s anger. In order to appease him, his spirit was moved from his small shrine to the larger and more prestigious Kanda Shrine. He was designated one of the main gods, and his spirit was placated—for a while. In 1874, Emperor Meiji visited the Kanda Shrine. It was viewed as inappropriate for an enemy of the imperial family like Masakado to be honored when the emperor was visiting, and so his deity status was revoked. His shrine was moved to a smaller building outside of the main shrine.\n\nTaira no Masakado’s anger returned in 1928. After the Great Kanto Earthquake destroyed much of the city, the site of his Kubizuka was chosen as the temporary location for the Ministry of Finance. Shortly afterwards, the Minister of Finance became sick and died. Over a dozen other employees died, and even more became sick or were injured in falls and accidents in the building. Rumors about the curse ran began to spread. The Ministry of Finance building was demolished and a memorial service for Masakado was held at the Kanda Shrine.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, a number of other accidents, fires, sicknesses, and mysterious sightings were attributed to the curse of Taira no Masakado. Each time, purification rituals were performed. Finally, in 1984, in response to public pressure, his deity status was reinstated. Today, great pains are taken not to anger his ghost. For example, it is common practice for television stations to visit the grave of his head, still located in what is now Otemachi, Tokyo. They pay their respects to him before his character appears on any show. The Kubizuka is maintained by an organization of local businesses and volunteers who have taken on the responsibility of upkeeping of his grave.\n\n",

It has a bulbous octopus-like head with the face of a bearded old man. It has eight tentacles, and wears human clothing. It looks like an old, bald priest, hence the name.\n\nBehavior: Little is known about the natural behavior of tako nyūdō. A famous scroll called the Bakemono Emaki, painted in 1666 by Kanō Munenobu, depicts a tako nyūdō dangling a fish above the head of an unagi hime. It appears to be teasing or perhaps seducing her, however no description or story accompanies the painting. Like the regular octopus, this yōkai octopus’s natural habitat is hidden from the human world, leaving its lifestyle a mystery.\n\nInteractions: In Shimane Prefecture, tako nyūdō are feared by fishermen who live along the Sea of Japan.

Teke teke are almost always women (though in a few versions of the urban legend, the ghost is male). She has no lower half; she runs about on her arms, creating the distinctive “teke teke” sound from which she gets her name.\n\nInteractions: Teke teke chases its victims down dark roads. Despite having no legs, a teke teke can run incredibly fast—so fast, in fact, that it can even catch up to victims who are speeding away in cars. When it catches them, something terrible happens—the legends are not always clear what. In some variations of the story the teke teke carries a sickle. It slices its victims in half at the waist and steals their legs.\n\nOrigin: Like with most urban legends, there are so many versions of the teke teke story that it is impossible to know what the original story was or where it began. Every locality has its own version with different details. In some stories, the teke teke was the victim of a tragic accident; in others, it was suicide. In some stories, certain magic charms can protect you from its wrath; in others nothing can protect you and you will certainly die. In some versions, the teke teke’s victims become teke teke themselves. There are a number of threads in common between many of the variations, and the most common ones point towards a woman from Hokkaidō named Kashima Reiko.\n\nLegends: In the years after World War 2, an office worker in Muroran, Hokkaidō was assaulted and raped by American military personnel. That night, she leaped off a bridge onto the railroad tracks and was hit by an oncoming train. The impact was so forceful that her body was torn in half at the waist. The severe cold of the Hokkaidō night caused her blood vessels to contract and prevented her from bleeding out quickly. Instead, she squirmed and wriggled about for help for several minutes. She crawled all the way to a train station and was seen by an attendant. Instead of trying to help her, the station attendant just covered her with a plastic tarp. She died a slow, agonizing death.\n\nAccording to legend, three days after hearing this story, you will see the ghost of a woman with no lower half. The ghost is that of the woman hit by the train. The ghost will try to catch you, and escape is impossible even in a car; the ghost can crawl at speeds of up to 150 km per hour. Some say that the ghost is searching for her legs, which were lost when she was cut in half. Others say that she is angry at humanity for not helping her when she was dying, and that she is simply out to slaughter as many people as she can. When she catches you, she will tear you in half and steal the lower half of your body.\n\nShortly after hearing the legend, she will ask you a riddle, either in a dream, or in a mysterious phone call. The only way to escape death is to answer her questions exactly the right way. She will ask you: “Do you need your legs?” You must reply: “I need them right now.” Then, she will ask you: “Who told you my story?” You must reply: “Kashima Reiko. Ka as in mask (仮面), shi as in death (死), ma as in demon (魔), rei as in ghost (霊), and ko as in accident (事故).” If you answer her riddles without mistake, she may just let you live.\n\n",

They live along the riverbanks, where they hunt fish. Their bodies are covered in hair, and the hair on their head resembles the the bobbed okappa hair style once popular among children in Japan. Their most notable features are their webbed hands and toes, and their long teeth which are sharp and jagged like files. They are close relatives of the much more well-known kappa.\n\nBehavior: Gangi kozō are not encountered outside of the riverbanks, and there may be a good reason for this; according to one theory, they are a transitional form of kappa. According to many legends, kappa transform from river spirits into hairy mountain spirits when the seasons change. The specific details differ quite a bit from place to place. However, in Yamaguchi prefecture, there is a hairy mountain spirit called a takiwaro which transforms into a water spirit called an enko (a variety of kappa). Some folklorists believe that the gangi kozō is a kind of takiwaro, and thus is merely a transitional form of a kappa. This would explain why so little is known of them.\n\nInteractions: Gangi kozō normally stay away from people, but occasionally encounter fishermen along the rivers they inhabit. When meeting a gangi kozō, fishermen often leave their largest, cheapest fish on the riverside as an offering.\n\nOrigin: Gangi kozō do not appear in any local legends, though stories of very similar-looking yokai do. The first and only written record of them is in Toriyama Sekien’s yokai encyclopedias. It is therefore possible that gangi kozō was made up by Toriyama Sekien based on the numerous legends of transforming kappa.\n\nAccording to Mizuki Shigeru, the name gangi kozō can be written with another set of kanji, 雁木小僧. These characters can mean “stepped pier” or “gear tooth” depending on the context. This writing reflects both the habitat of the gangi kozō as well as its mouth full of sharp teeth, which resembles a toothed gear.\n\n",

It takes place between 1:00 and 3:00 in the morning, during the hour of the ox. This is the period of darkest night, when the border between the world of the living and the world of the dead is weakest. During this hour, evil spirits are at their greatest power.\n\nInteractions: There are a number of complicated steps required to perform this curse ritual, and they vary from account to account. In general, you must first construct a wara ningyō containing a small piece of the intended target’s body—a piece of hair, blood, fingernails, or skin, for example. Alternatively, you may use an image of their target, or a piece of paper with the target’s name written on it. Then, you put on the ceremonial dress—a white kimono and obi, with thick white face powder. An upturned trivet is placed on your head, and you attach tapers to its legs and light them. Tall, single-toothed geta are worn on your feet. A mirror is carried over your breast, a dagger is tucked behind the obi, and a comb is held between your teeth.\n\nThus prepared, you must sneak into a shrine during the hour of the ox and approach the shrine’s sacred tree. Then, you hammer a long iron nail through the wara ningyō into the tree—symbolically breaking the barrier between the world of the living and the spirit world. You call out to evil spirits, demons, and yōkai to come into the world. This ritual must be repeated every night for many nights, and it is very important that the person performing the curse not be seen. If there are any witnesses, they must be killed immediately. Otherwise the evil of this curse will rebound onto the caster.\n\nOnce the ritual is completed, something—it is not clear what—terrible happens. According to some accounts, the curse victim dies an agonizing death upon completion of the ritual. In other accounts, the entire process is torture for the victim, causing days of suffering while the curse is being performed. In some stories, the curse summons yōkai which haunt the victim, and in other stories, the person performing the ritual transforms into a powerful oni or kijo.\n\nLegends: A few shrines are well-known for this sort of black magic. Kifune Shrine and Jishu Shrine in Kyōto, and Ikurei Shrine in Okayama Prefecture (old Bitchū Province) are the most famous ones. In the old days, these were popular locations for jealous lovers to perform this curse. Even today, every now and then, shrine officials find wara ningyō hammered into trees at these shrines.\n\n",

They also inhabit large caverns deep underground.\n\nBehavior: Ōnamazu behave much like their smaller cousins. They dig in the muck, and thrash about when disturbed or excited. Due to their titanic mass, the thrashing of ōnamazu is considerably more violent than ordinary catfish, to the point where they are dangerous to humans. When these monstrous fish get excited, they shake the earth with their violent thrashing, causing devastating earthquakes in the areas near where they live.\n\nInteractions: Ōnamazu do not normally interact with people, however during the Edo period they were popularly depicted in newspaper illustrations. Usually these pictures showed a huge, grotesque catfish being subdued by a large number of people, gods, or even other yokai, desperately trying to calm its thrashing.\n\nOrigin: Long ago, common belief was that earthquakes were caused by large dragons which lived deep in the earth. During the Edo period, the idea of catfish causing earthquakes gradually began to displace dragons in popular lore as the origin of seismic activity. By the 1855 Great Ansei Earthquake, the ōnamazu had become the popular culprit to blame for earthquakes. This was due mostly to the hundreds of illustrations of thrashing catfish which accompanied newspapers reporting the news of that disaster. They were so popular they spawned an entire genre of woodblock print: namazu-e (catfish pictures).\n\nThe reason catfish came to represent earthquakes was due to a large number of witnesses observing catfish behaving oddly—thrashing about violently for seemingly no reason—just before the earthquake. Rumor quickly spread that that catfish had some kind of ability to foresee the coming disaster. Since then, the catfish has regularly appeared as a symbol for earthquakes—either as the cause or as a warning sign of the coming disaster. Recent studies have shown that catfish are in fact very electrosensitive and do become significantly more active shortly before an earthquake hits—showing that there is more to this myth than meets the eye!\n\nLegends: The Kashima Shrine in Ibaraki prefecture is the source of a famous story about ōnamazu. The deity of the shrine, a patron deity of martial arts named Takemikazuchi, is said to have subdued an ōnamazu. He pinned it down underneath the shrine, piercing its head and tail with a sacred stone which still remains in the shrine today—the top of the stone protrudes from the ground. Earthquakes that take place during the 10th month of the lunar calendar—”the godless month,” when the gods all travel to Izumo—are said to be due to Takemikazuchi’s absence from the shrine.\n\nDuring the 2011 Tōhoku disaster, the Kashima Shrine was badly damaged by an earthquake. The large stone gate was destroyed, stone lanterns were knocked down, and the water level in the reflecting pond changed. The gate was rebuilt in 2014.\n\n",

They take the appearance of oversized kamuro, little girls employed as a servants in brothels. Only they are much larger than a typical girl of 5.\n\nOrigin: The origins of this yōkai are vague. Ōkaburo are best known for their depiction by Toriyama Sekien. His ōkaburo is actually a male yōkai dressed up as a young kamuro, wearing a chrysanthemum-patterned kimono. His description makes an allusion to Peng Zu, a legendary Taoist wizard from China. Peng Zu lived past the age of 700 by having lots of sex with both women and men, and keeping a strict herbal diet which included licking the dew off of chrysanthemums. For this Peng Zu took the nickname Kiku-jidō, or chrysanthemum boy. Sekien likely intended his ōkaburo to be a pun referring to homosexual brothels in which young boys were dressed up as kamuro and offered to male patrons. Aside from the obvious connotations of having a young boy dressed up as a kamuro, the chrysanthemum was used as a secret symbol for homosexuality; the shape of the petals was supposed to represent an anus. The nickname chrysanthemum boy, the chrysanthemums on the kimono, and the image of licking the dew off of “chrysanthemums” leave little to the imagination as to what Sekien was alluding to with this yōkai.\n\nA story of an ōkamuro with very different origins comes from a pleasure house in Hiroshima, where a particularly short-tempered oiran was employed. One day, her ohaguro (a tea-like mixture of hot water and iron filings used to blacken the teeth of courtesans) had been improperly prepared. The color would not stick to her teeth. Enraged, she grabbed the nearest kamuro and poured the entire pot of boiling liquid down the little girl’s throat. The girl, vomiting up her insides, smeared her bloody handprints along the wall as she died in anguish. Ever since, it was said that the voice of that young kamuro could be heard at night, calling out for vengeance against the oiran.\n\n",

They have long, serpentine bodies, fins, and can breathe both air and water. Wani are able to shapeshift into humans, and there are even tales of wani and humans falling in love.\n\nBehavior: Wani are the rulers of the oceans and gods of the sea. They live in splendid coral palaces deep on the ocean floor. Wani have a complex political hierarchy which mirrors that of the surface world. There are kings and queens, princes and princess, courtesans, servants, and so on. Watatsumi, also known as Ryūjin, is the greatest of them. He rules the sea from his palace Ryūgū-jō. He controls the ebb and flow of the ocean using the tide jewels kanju and manju.\n\nOrigin: Wani appear in the earliest written records of Japanese myths, the Kojiki and Nihon shoki. Their stories almost certainly date back even further, into the mists of prehistory. Scholars disagree over whether the earliest legends of wani originated in Japan or were imported from other cultures, citing similarities between wani and the Chinese long or the Indian naga. Wani play an important role in Japanese mythology, including in the mythological founding of Japan.\n\nThe word wani first appears in the Kojiki written with man’yōgana (an archaic phonetic syllabary). Later it came to be written with the kanji 鰐. Wani came to refer to sharks and other “sea monsters” that sailors and fishermen might encounter out at sea. The sea was a dangerous and mysterious place, and sailors may have thought that sharks were the powerful serpents of legends. Over time, the meaning of the word expanded to include to crocodiles as well as sharks, and then shifted to refer only to crocodiles. Today both the kanji and the name wani mean “crocodile” and are rarely used to refer to sea dragons.\n\nLegends: One of the most famous wani legends is the story of Toyotama hime, the daughter of Watatsumi. She married a surface dweller named Hoori. Hoori and his brother Hoderi were grandchildren of Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. One day Hoori borrowed and lost Hoderi’s fish hook. Hoderi insisted that Hoori find and return the lost hook, so Hoori went into the ocean to look for it. He was unable to find the hook, but instead he discovered the palace where the dragon king of the sea lived. Hoori visited the palace and asked Watatsumi for help finding the hook. With the dragon god’s help, Hoori found the hook, but in the meantime, Hoori had fallen in love with Toyotama hime, the daughter of the dragon god.\n\nHoori and Toyotama hime were married, and they lived together at the bottom of the sea for three years. Eventually, Hoori became homesick and longed to see country again. Together, he and his wife returned to the surface world with Hoderi’s lost hook. While on land, Toyotami hime gave birth to a son. When she went into labor, she asked Hoori not to look upon her, because she had to change into her true form in order to bear her child. Hoori became curious and sneaked a peak at his wife while she gave birth. He was shocked to see, instead of his wife, a huge wani cradling their newborn son. The wani was, of course, Toyotama hime in her true form. Toyotama hime was unable to forgive his betrayal, and was so ashamed that she fled back into the ocean and never saw Hoori or her son again.\n\nAlthough Toyotama hime abandoned her son, her sister Tamayori came to raise him in her absence. The boy, Ugayafukiaezu, grew up to marry Tamayori, and together they had a son. Their son was Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan.\n\n",

They have long, scaled bodies, serpentine tails, sharp teeth and claws, and often have horns, antlers, spines, and beards. Some tatsu have multiple limbs or heads. Many disguise themselves as humans and are never seen in their natural forms.\n\nBehavior: Tatsu are strongly connected to water—be it rain, rivers, seas, or oceans—and are considered to be water gods. They live in splendid palaces at the bottom of deep seas, or in other secluded places. They usually live far from human-inhabited areas, but occasionally make their homes near Buddhist temples. Like Western dragons, they hoard vast amounts of treasure and keep powerful magical artifacts in their homes. Many are great villains, tormenting mankind out of spite, while others are pure and kind, offering their wisdom and power to those seeking it. Some tatsu even allow worthy heroes to visit them, and lend their magical items to noble warriors.\n\nInteractions: Tatsu rarely concern themselves with human affairs unless it affects them directly. They accept worship and sacrifices from humans; many temples maintain the holy grounds of local dragons, and countless Japanese make pilgrimages to holy mountains inhabited by tatsu. Tatsu receive prayers for rain or for protection from floods, and other water-related requests. Fireworks festivals, ritual dragon dances, and other local celebrations honor these dragon gods all over the Japanese islands.\n\nOrigin: Tatsu are one of the oldest supernatural creatures known in Japan. The first recorded stories go back to the earliest written accounts of Japanese history and mythology, the Kojiki and the Nihongi. Over the centuries, tales of the Chinese long and Indian naga were incorporated into Japanese mythology. Today’s Japanese dragons are an amalgamation of these imported myths merged with the indigenous water deities of prehistoric Japan.\n\nLegends: The Japanese imperial family, the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world, is supposedly descended from dragons (as well as other gods). The monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BCE by Emperor Jimmu, the legendary first ruler of Japan. His father was the son of Toyotama hime, who in turn was the daughter of Ryūjin, the dragon god of the sea. So by tradition the emperor of Japan is the direct descendant of a dragon.\n\n",

One of the most common animal possessions is called tanuki tsuki—possession by tanuki spirits.\n\nInteractions: When tanuki possess human beings, their victims develop strange new personality traits. One of the most common changes is gluttony. Victims become intensely hungry and eat and eat, even going so far as to eat spoiled and ruined food. Although possessed humans grow vast waists from this gluttony, all of the nutrition goes to the tanuki spirits. Victims only grow weaker and weaker until finally they die from malnutrition. Other common symptoms of tanuki possession include unexplained illness, melancholy, becoming overly talkative, sudden outbursts of violence, or abnormally increased libido.\n\nTanuki possess humans for various reasons, but common ones include revenge for destroying the tanuki’s den, or simply just as a prank. In rare cases, some human families have harnessed the power of animal possession for their own use. Some legends tell of people offering food to old, wild tanuki, taming them, and then using their spirits to possess their enemies.\n\nBecause tanuki are powerful yōkai, it is difficult to escape tanuki tsuki. Either the tanuki must leave of its own will, or it must be driven out by a powerful yamabushi, priest, or onmyōji. Another solution is to deify the tanuki. A tanuki elevated to the level of a kami will no longer possess humans. Many villages—particularly in Shikoku—have built shrines to worship particularly troublesome tanuki.\n\n",

They are holy creatures, and bring happiness and blessings to those around them.\n\nInteractions: Myōbu statues are most often found at Inari shrines, taking the place of the koma inu which adorn other shrines. These foxes act as both guardians and symbols of good luck and blessing. People often leave offerings of holy sake, sekihan (red rice and red beans), inarizushi, and fried tofu at these shrines. These foods are all said to be foxes’ favorites.\n\nOrigin: Foxes were considered holy animals since long before recorded history began in Japan. The farmers of ancient Japan revered foxes, which preyed on the mice and rats which destroy crops. Foxes have long been associated with Inari, the god of the harvest. Inari is said to use foxes as servants and messengers, and the majority of the foxes in his employ are the holy, white-furred kind known as myōbu.\n\nMyōbu statues are commonly found at Inari shrines. They often carry sacred objects in their mouths, such as the round jewel often carried by koma inu in other shrines. Myōbu can also be seen carrying spiral keys, sheaves of grain, and scrolls. These all carry special significance in Inari worship. The round jewel represents both the soul of Inari, and its form is a symbol of a grain storehouse. The spiral key is an archaic design of the keys used with traditional farm warehouses. The key represents the desire to unlock the storehouse; i.e. soul of Inari. The sheaves of grain represent the five grains (wheat, rice, beans, awa millet, and kibi millet) which are important in East Asian traditions. Finally, the scroll represents knowledge and wisdom.\n\n",

After he died, he transformed—some say into a terrible onryō, some say into a great tengu—and inflicted his wrath upon the imperial court at Kyōto. Along with Sugawara no Michizane and Taira no Masakado, he is one of the legendary Nihon San Dai Onryō—the Three Great Onryō of Japan.\n\nOrigin: Prince Akihito was born in 1119 CE, the first son of Emperor Toba. At least that was on the official registry. It was an open secret, known by everyone in the court, that Akihito was actually sired by the retired former Emperor Shirakawa. Akihito was not well liked by his “father,” who constantly referred to him as a bastard. His true father Shirakawa may have been the former emperor, but he still wielded considerable power in his retirement. When Prince Akihito was 5 and Emperor Toba was 21, Shirakawa forced Toba into retirement. Akihito became Emperor Sutoku.\n\nAfter Shirakawa died in 1129, retired Emperor Toba began orchestrating his trap against Emperor Sutoku. He convinced him that the cloistered life of retired emperor was much better than being the actual emperor. He suggested that Sutoku adopt Toba’s son Prince Narihito, and retire. In 1142, Sutoku finally did so. Toba oversaw the process, and made sure to record that the emperor was retiring and passing the throne on to Narihito instead of his own progeny. This ensured that Sutoku would wield no power over the young emperor, nor would any future son ever become emperor. The 3-year old Narihito became Emperor Konoe, and the retired Emperor Toba wielded all of the power behind the throne. Toba sent Sutoku’s allies to distant provinces, and filled the capital with his own allies. There was nothing Sutoku could do.\n\nEmperor Konoe remained sickly and childless his whole life. He passed away without an heir in 1155 at the age of 17. By this time, Sutoku had his own son. He saw an opportunity to recover his standing. Sutoku and his allies claimed that the throne should pass on to Sutoku’s son. Instead the imperial court declared that Toba’s fourth son would become Emperor Go-Shirakawa. When Toba died the following year, this dispute escalated into a miniature civil war known as the Hōgen Rebellion. The war was decided in a single battle. The forces of Go-Shirakawa were victorious.\n\nAfter the Hōgen Rebellion, Go-Shirakawa’s forces were merciless. Those who fought against the emperor were executed, along with their entire families. Former Emperor Sutoku was banished from Kyōto and forced to spend the rest of his days exiled to Sanuki Province. He shaved his head and became a monk, devoting himself copying holy manuscripts to send back to Kyōto. The court feared that the deposed Sutoku would attempt to curse them. It was rumored that he had bitten off his own tongue and wrote the manuscripts in his own blood, imbuing them with his hatred for the merciless imperial court. The court added insult to injury by refusing to accept any of his manuscripts.\n\nIn 1164, Sutoku passed away, defeated, deposed, and humiliated—and most importantly full of rage for the imperial court. When news of his death reached Emperor Go-Shirakawa, the emperor ignored it. He ordered that nobody should go into mourning, and that no state funeral would be held for such a criminal.\n\nLegends: After his death, strange things began to happen. Sutoku’s body was set aside while its caretakers awaited funeral instructions from the emperor. After 20 days, his body was still as fresh as it had been on the day he died. While his coffin was taken to be cremated, a terrible storm rolled in. The caretakers placed the casket on the ground to take shelter. After the storm passed, the stones around the casket were soaked with fresh blood. When his body was finally cremated, the ashes descended upon Kyōto in a dark cloud.\n\nAfterwards, for many years, disaster upon disaster struck the capital. Go-Shirakawa’s successor, Emperor Nijo, died suddenly at age 23. Storms, plagues, fires, droughts, and earthquakes all pounded the capital. Imperial power weakened. Clan rivalries set into motion by the Hōgen Rebellion escalated. Many of Go-Shirakawa’s allies were killed in battles, and the country stepped closer and closer to all-out civil war. In 1180, the Genpei War broke out. In 5 bloody years, the power of the imperial court had vanished, and the Kamakura shogunate took over Japan. All of this was attributed to Emperor Sutoku’s vengeance.\n\nSutoku finally returned to the capital during the Meiji era. In 1868, he was enshrined as a kami in the Shiramine Shrine in Kyōto. The Takaya Shrine in Kagawa also enshrines one of the stones onto which Sutoku’s blood flowed during the rainstorm before his cremation. Despite this, there are still rumors that his curse might still linger. In 2012, when NHK broadcast the drama Taira no Kiyomori, an earthquake struck the Kanto region right at the moment when Emperor Sutoku transformed into an onryō.\n\n",

As their name suggests, they are related to the uncomfortable smiles that people make when trying to hide their feelings of discomfort. They cause ill-will, disgust and encourage arguments among those around them.

She is most famous for being the wife of Abe no Yasuna and the mother of Abe no Seimei. Her story is preserved in a number of kabuki and bunraku plays. The Inari shrine near where Abe no Yasuna first met Kuzunoha still stands today, and is popularly known as the Kuzunoha Shrine.\n\nLegends: During the reign of Emperor Murakami (946—967 CE), the onmyōji Abe no Yasuna sought to rebuild his family house. The Abe family had once been a rich and powerful one, but their land and status were lost years before by Yasuna’s father, who had been tricked by con men. While rebuilding his house, Yasuna regularly traveled to the Inari shrine in Shinoda, Izumi Province, to pray for the god’s blessings.\n\nOne day, while walking through the woods of Shinoda, a beautiful white fox jumped in front of Yasuna’s path. It was being chased by a hunter, and it asked Yasuna to save it. Yasuna knew that white foxes were holy to Inari, and he helped the creature to escape. Shortly afterwards, the hunter came to where Yasuna was and the two got into a fight. Yasuna was wounded in the fight, and fell to the ground.\n\nAfter the hunter left, a young woman came out of the forest to Yasuna’s side. She told him her name was Kuzunoha. She took Yasuna all the way back to his home, and nursed him back to health. The woman continued to visit Yasuna, caring for him and checking up on his recovery. At some point during her visits, Kuzunoha and Yasuna had fallen in love, and so when he was better they got married.\n\nEventually Kuzunoha became pregnant, and she bore Yasuna a son. They three of them lived happily for some time. However, when their son was five years old, he witnessed something strange. Some say it was when she looked in a mirror, others say it was while she was sleeping; but his mother accidentally let her true form appear for a brief second: she a white-furred kitsune!\n\nHer secret having been discovered, Kuzunoha had no choice but to leave her beloved family. Holding a brush in her mouth, she wrote a farewell tanka on the paper door and vanished:\n\nIf you love me, come and visit, in the forest of Shinoda in Izumi, the resentful kudzu leaf\n\nWhen Yasuna read her poem, he realized that his beloved wife was the fox whom he had saved years earlier. He and their son traveled to the forests of Shinoda, where Kuzunoha had first entered the world of humankind. There, Kuzunoha appeared before them one last time. She presented them a crystal ball and a golden box as parting gifts, and then she left her human family forever.\n\nKuzunoha and Yasuna’s son grew up to become a powerful sorcerer, thanks to the magical gifts his mother had given him, her yōkai lineage, and his father’s onmyōji training. He took the name Abe no Seimei, and became the most powerful onmyōji in all of Japanese history.\n\n",

Her story became popular in the Edo period, and is depicted in novels, woodblock prints, and kabuki. The details of her story vary quite a bit from version to version.\n\nLegends: After Taira no Masakado was defeated and his rebellion quashed, the imperial court declared Masakado’s entire family to be traitors and ordered their execution. Two of Masakado’s children, Yoshikado and Satsuki hime, somehow managed to escape their execution. They remained in hiding at a temple at the base of Mount Tsukuba for years. Satsuki hime became a devoted nun, but her brother was not interested in religion. He spent his time exploring the mountain and playing at being a samurai.\n\nOne day while exploring Mount Tsukuba, Yoshikado encountered a mysterious wizard named Nikushisen. Nikushisen informed Yoshikado that he was the heir of Taira no Masakado, and gave him a magic scroll containing the secrets of frog magic. Yoshikado returned to his sister, and told her everything Nikushisen had said. He gave her the scroll. She studied it and also became a master of frog magic, and took the name Takiyasha hime. The two of them decided to fulfill their father’s dream of overthrowing the emperor and ushering in a new order.\n\nIn a different version of the story, instead of Yoshikado meeting Nikushisen, Satsuki hime secretly began to perform the dreaded curse ushi no koku mairi—the shrine visit at the hour of the ox. Every night, she snuck into the Kifune Shrine and performed the ritual. After twenty-one nights, she awakened the aramitama—the violent, wicked spirit—of the Kifune Shrine. The aramitama spoke to her, granting her the knowledge of onmyōdō, and instructing her to take the name Takiyasha hime.\n\nTakiyasha hime and Yoshikado returned to their father’s fortress of Sōma Castle in Shimosa province. They called on the surviving soldiers who remained loyal to their father’s cause. Using her newly acquired black magic, Takiyasha hime raised an army of yōkai to continue her father’s rebellion against the emperor.\n\nŌya no Tarō Mitsukuni, a warrior who was knowledgeable about onmyōdō, had heard of Takiyasha hime’s plans and set out to Sōma Castle to investigate if the rumors were true. When he arrived, Takiyasha hime disguised herself as a prostitute and tried to seduce Mitsukuni. However, Mitsukuni suspected a trap and told her about the brutal death of Taira no Masakado. Takiyasha hime could not contain her emotion, and she fled from Mitsukuni. That night, she ambushed him with an army of skeletons and yōkai. According to Utagawa Kuniyoshi’s famous ukiyoe print, Takiyasha hime unleashed a gashadokuro upon him—a gigantic skeleton as tall as a castle.\n\nRiding into battle on top of a giant toad, Takiyasha hime assaulted the brave warrior Mitsukuni. In the end, despite her magic, she was defeated just as her father was. Her short rebellion was snuffed out just as his was.\n\nToday, many statues of frogs decorate Taira no Masakado’s gravesite in Kubizuka. The Japanese word for frog, kaeru, is a homophone of the word meaning “return.” Masakado’s severed head longed to return to his hometown, and patrons hope that Masakado’s spirit will “kaeru,” return, to heaven—and not cause any more harm on Earth. It is also said that this reflects the “frog magic” that Nikushisen taught to his daughter, Takiyasha hime.\n\n",

The clacking sound of a loom can be heard near the banks of a pond where an unagi hime lives.\n\nInteractions: Unagi hime rarely interact with humans due to the fact that they live deep underwater. When human fishermen come in contact with an eel yōkai, they usually leave the area where it was encountered alone and try not to disturb it. Fishermen who catch eels near a ponds inhabited by unagi hime are scolded by their peers.\n\nOrigin: In Miyagi Prefecture, eels were believed to be guardians of the ponds they inhabit.

She told the warrior that on the following night, the spider who owned a nearby pond would come and fight her. She begged the warrior to stay by the pond and protect her, for with his help she would surely win the battle. Genbē promised to help. However, on the following evening, he grew cowardly and stayed at home, shaking. The next morning, he returned to the pond and found the severed head of a giant eel. Its unblinking eyes stared at him with such hatred that he lost his mind. He threw himself into the pond and drowned.\n\n",

It was a common practice during large construction projects from ancient times through the 16th century. However there is evidence that hitobashira were still being used in some construction projects during the 20th century.\n\nBehavior: This form of sacrifice was used as a magical ward for the building being constructed. It was believed that the sacrifice of a human soul would appease the nature spirits in an area—particularly the river spirits in areas where flooding was common. They were also used to ward castles against assault, fire, and other disasters both man-made and natural.\n\nOrigin: Although hitobashira literally means human pillar, the actual meaning is more complicated. Pillars and Shinto have a long relationship—kami can be enshrined in pillar-like sacred trees, the oldest shrines were built upon pillars, and hashira, in addition to meaning pillar, is also used as the josūshi—Japanese counter word—for kami. The bashira in hitobashira refers not to a literal pillar, but actually to this counter word. The human was enshrined in a manner similar to a kami of the building to which he or she was sacrificed, becoming both a literal pillar and a connection to the gods. Very often, small stone memorials were erected in honor of the hitobashira who were sacrificed to a building. Some still stand today.\n\nLegends: A few famous castles in Japan are connected to legends of hitobashira. Maruoka Castle in Fukui Prefecture (old Echizen Province), one of the oldest surviving castles in Japan, is said to contain a hitobashira in the central pillar of the keep.\n\nWhile Maruoka Castle was being constructed, its walls kept collapsing no matter how many times they were repaired. It was decided that a person should be sacrificed and made into a hitobashira in order to improve the stability of the castle. A poor, one-eyed woman named Oshizu was selected for the honor of becoming a hitobashira. As a reward for her sacrifice, she was promised that her son would be made a samurai. After she was sacrificed the castle was completed. However, before her son could be made a samurai, the castle’s lord was transferred to another province, and the promise was left unkept.\n\nEvery year thereafter, the castle’s moat overflowed when the heavy spring rains came. The people of Maruoka blamed this on Oshizu’s vengeance, and called this rain “tears of Oshizu’s sorrow.” Afterwards, a cenotaph was erected for Oshizu inside the castle grounds to calm her spirit.\n\n",

            "content": "菅原道真\nすがわらのみちざねAppearance: Sugawara no Michizane was a scholar, poet, and politician who fell out of favor with the emperor and died in exile. He lived from 845 to 903 CE, and is considered one of the greatest scholars and poets in all of Japanese history. After his death, he returned from the grave as a wrathful onryō to wreak his vengeance upon those who had wronged him in life. This earned him a position among the Nihon San Dai Onryō—the Three Great Onryō of Japan.\n\nOrigin: Sugawara no Michizane was born the eldest son of a high-ranking family of scholars. From a very early age, he showed his brilliance, composing elegant poems by the age of five. He was well-educated and lived a privileged life, gradually climbing the ranks of the bureaucracy and increasing his public standing.\n\nSugawara no Michizane was an excellent student and scholar. Passing the highest level of government exams at age 26, he received the equivalent of a PhD at age 33. Michizane was selected to be governor of Sanuki Province in 886. During his time as governor he composed a great deal of poetry. In 888, during the Akō Incident, he supported Emperor Uda in his rivalry with Fujiwara no Mototsune. This action earned him a great deal of political clout. When the Emperor consolidated his power, he demoted officials from the Fujiwara clan and promoted officials from the Minamoto clan. Michizane was not a noble, but he too was rewarded. Hs rank rose even further, and he picked up many important court titles, including Ambassador to the Tang Dynasty. This caused unrest among the nobles—particularly the Fujiwaras. They felt indignant that a non-noble scholar should be elevated to such elite ranks.\n\nWhen Emperor Uda abdicated to Emperor Daigo, Sugawara no Michizane’s fortunes declined rapidly. Both Michizane and Fujiwara no Tokihira—the son of Fujiwara no Mototsune, whom Michizane had censured years ago—were the emperor’s primary advisors. Tokihira advised the emperor that he should pacify the indignant Fujiwara nobility by sending Michizane away. The emperor listened. Michizane lost his rank and titles, and was demoted from his high position to very minor regional government post at Dazaifu, Chikuzen Province. There, he experienced a thankless life of hard work under much stricter and more severe conditions than in Kyōto.\n\nDespite his humiliation and exile to Kyūshū, Sugawara no Michizane continued to work hard and earnestly for the sake of the country. All the while he prayed for the well-being of the imperial family and the safety of Japan. His hard work was never acknowledged, and he never regained his prestige. He regretted his demotion, and longed for his beloved Kyōto for the rest of his life. Late in the second month of 903, as the plums were blossoming, Michizane died. His heart was filled with loneliness and resentment.\n\nLegends: After Sugawara no Michizane’s death, a series of disasters struck Kyōto. Plague and drought spread over the city. His rival Fujiwara no Tokihira died at the age of 39. The sons of Emperor Daigo became sick and died one after another. A lightning bolt struck the Seiryōden palace, causing a fire which killed a number of the officials who had participated in Michizane’s demotion and exile. A few months later, Emperor Daigo himself became sick and died. Everyone in the capital had become convinced that Michizane’s ghost had become a thunder god and was punishing those who had wronged him.\n\nSugawara no Michizane’s onryō continued to curse the capital with disaster upon disaster. Eventually, the emperor built a shrine to his spirit and posthumously restored his rank and office. He removed any mention of Michizane’s exile from the official records. However, it did not appease his spirit, and the disasters kept coming. Finally, in 987, during the reign of Emperor Ichijō, Sugawara no Michizane was promoted and deified as the highest rank of state kami. A special shrine was built for him in northern Kyōto, and a festival was established in his honor. Michizane became known as Tenman Tenjin, the god of scholarship. The curse was finally appeased.\n\nTenjin remains a popular god to this day. Paintings of him are hung in homes across the country, and students from all over Japan visit his shrines to pray for luck on their school examinations. Tenjin shrines commonly hold festivals in late February, when plum trees start to bloom, and when school examination results are posted. The plum tree is commonly associated with Tenjin, as it was his favorite tree. Shrines dedicated to him commonly have plum trees on their grounds. Legend has it that while in exile in Dazaifu, he longed so deeply for his favorite plum tree that one night it flew from Kyōto to Kyūshū to be with him. That tree still stands today at the Dazaifu Tenman-gu in Fukuoka.\n\n",

It is a regal animal, holy and highly revered. The kirin is often considered a god in its own right. Resembling a deer with scales like a dragon’s covering its body, the kirin is a chimerical beast. It has a tail like an ox and a flowing mane. Its body and mane are covered in brilliant, holy fire and its face is the picture of utter serenity.\n\nBehavior: A gentle animal, the kirin never eats the flesh of other beings, and takes great care never to tread on any living thing, even insects. When it walks, it does so without trampling a single blade of grass. Its beauty is only surpassed by its rarity; the unicorn-like kirin only appears during periods of world peace. They are seen only in lands owned by wise and benevolent people and during the reigns of noble and enlightened rulers, where they herald a golden age. Although kirin never harm good and pure souls, they are swift and fierce to attack if threatened, breathing holy fire from their mouths.\n\nInteractions: Because kirin are beasts of purity and goodness, they have been used in carvings and paintings as symbols of these virtues since early times. They are also seen as symbols of justice and wisdom. Because of their holiness, images of kirin frequently adorn temples and shrines. Omens of great luck and fortune, the appearance of a kirin is believed to be a sign of the arrival of a great leader or a wise man.\n\nOrigin: Kirin were introduced to Japan via Chinese myths and legends where they are known as qilin. Over time, the Chinese and Japanese version diverged into slightly different creatures. In Japan, the kirin is considered to be the most powerful and sacred beast of all, surpassing the hōō and tatsu.\n\nGiraffes are also called kirin in Japanese, named for the traits they share with the holy kirin. Their long legs, scale-like pattern, gentle nature, and the knobs on their heads must have reminded the first Japanese to see a giraffe of this most sacred of beasts.\n\n",

Wara ningyō most commonly depict humans, but they are occasionally made in the shape of horses or other animals too.\n\nInteractions: Wara ningyō are used extensively as wards against evil. During the Heian period, wara ningyō would be placed along the sides of the roads for protection against plague. It was hoped that the evil spirits which brought disease would nest in the straw bodies instead of living human bodies. Afterwards, the straw dolls would be discarded into a river, which would also purify the evil spirits.\n\nWara ningyō are popular devices in a number of dark rituals. They are combined with something from the recipient of the curse, such as a piece of hair. This transforms the doll into a substitute for the intended target. Long nails are pushed through the wara ningyō, harming the subject as well as the doll.\n\nThere are specific rules for creating different types of wara ningyō. These detail the materials to be used, the way the dolls are constructed, and the objects to be inserted into them. It can be difficult to find the materials needed to perform curses. The required items are not sold in most stores. However, some websites sell premade curse kits that contain all of the items you might need to perform a specific curse, including a wara ningyō, long nails, a mallet, pre-written curses with blanks for the recipient’s name, and other accessories.

They are shy and jumpy, so they prefer storerooms which remain closed during the day and are only rarely opened.\n\nInteractions: Nando babā are not violent and don’t do anything particularly harmful to humans. When someone opens the storeroom door, they quickly scurry away and hide, and so they are rarely encountered. If the door is opened suddenly and they are taken by surprise, they will leap out of the storeroom screaming, and chase people around the house. If you strike them on the head with a broom, they will become disoriented. Then they will run away and hide under the floorboards.\n\nIn some areas, nando babā are believed to steal newborn infants. However, this is due to confusion between nando babā and the much more dangerous yama uba.\n\nOrigin: Nando babā were probably once protector spirits, a kind of house god which inhabited storerooms. In ancient Japanese religion, there were different tutelary deities for every part of the house. As ancient traditions were replaced by newer ones, old customs died away, leaving yōkai in place of the forgotten gods.\n\n",

They return to the world of the living because of their strong attachment to their child, and their lingering motherly duties. Like all yūrei, these ghosts appear as faint images of their former selves. They often appear wearing burial clothing, or else the clothes that they wore in their lifetime. However, kosodate yūrei often appear less horrific—even slightly loving—when compared to scarier types of yūrei. They appear to shopkeepers or travelers on the road at night, and often return to the same place over and over again.\n\nInteractions: Kosodate yūrei exist to fulfill one purpose: to see to the well-being of their child. They try to do this by buying candy or other things for their children. They have no money, so they pay with whatever they can—sometimes even with dead leaves. They seek out living people, whom they try to lead back to the location of their waiting baby. If the baby is discovered and taken care of, the kosodate yūrei can finally rest. Until then, though, she will appear every night to find help for her child.\n\nLegends: Kosodate yūrei stories are very common. Although the details vary from place to place, one common version goes like this:\n\nOne rainy night, a shopkeeper was closing up his shop when he heard a tapping sound at the window. Looking out, he saw a woman standing pathetically in the rain, cold and drenched. He asked her if she needed help, but all she said was, “One candy please.” Even though the shop was closed, the shopkeeper felt sorry for the poor woman, so he sold her the candy. She paid him one mon—a very low denomination coin—and vanished into the night.\n\nThe next night, she came at the very same time, looking forlorn and disheveled. Again, she asked the shopkeeper, in a voice almost too faint to hear, “One candy please.” The shopkeeper gave her a candy, and again she paid with one mon, and left just as quietly as she had come.\n\nEvery night for six nights, this exact scenario played out. On the seventh night, she returned, but this time had no money. When she asked “One candy please,” she presented a handful of leaves. The shopkeeper told her that he could not accept leaves as payment. “Then take this instead,” she said, handing him her coat. The shopkeeper protested, but she insisted. Finally he gave in and accepted the trade.\n\nThe next day, a merchant from a neighboring village passed through the town. He stopped in his friend’s shop, and the shopkeeper told him of the strange woman who came visiting every night, and of the coat that she gave him as payment. When the merchant saw the strange woman’s coat hanging in the shop, he went pale. “That is the coat of my friend’s wife!”\n\n“Really? Perhaps it was she who came to the store?”\n\n“That is impossible! She died one week ago. She was buried in this coat!”\n\nThe merchant and the shopkeeper looked at each other in disbelief. They went to the temple where she was buried to tell the head priest what the shopkeeper had seen. The priest scolded them for believing in such superstitions. Afterwards he took them to the woman’s grave to show them that all was okay. When they reached the grave, however, they heard the unmistakable screaming of a newborn baby coming from under the earth!\n\nThey dug up the grave and discovered that it was indeed the corpse woman who had been visiting the shop! What’s more, entwined in her arms, a living baby wrapped up in cloth. The woman had given birth posthumously in her coffin. Wrapped up with the baby were the six mostly-eaten pieces of candy, which had kept the baby from starving during the week. Its mother had bought the candy with the six mon traditionally placed with a corpse to pay the guardians of the underworld.\n\nThey took the baby from the corpse and returned it to its family. When they reburied the woman’s body, the corpse had a serene expression on its face. And the ghostly visitor to the candy store was never seen again.\n\n",

Stepping outside to check and see, they discover a half-transparent, ghost-like oxcart with an enormous, grotesque face parked outside of their home.\n\nOrigin: Carriage yōkai have existed in picture scrolls for hundreds of years. They may originally have been a kind of tsukumogami, or object-turned-yōkai. Most of these scrolls were created for their vivid imagery rather than for any particular story. Oboroguruma may have initially been created without any backstory. When Toriyama Sekien published his yōkai bestiaries, he included the oboroguruma and gave a description. He linked it to a famous scene in The Tale of Genji when Lady Rokujō and her rival Lady Aoi competed for a parking space and got into a carriage fight.\n\nLong ago, sightseeing in the capital was accomplished by means of oxcart taxis. When it got crowded—particularly during festival seasons—the taxi drivers got into carriage fights. They slammed their carriages against each other to grab the best spots for sightseeing. Just like parking can be a problem in cities today, parking in ancient Kyōto was a huge source of frustration.\n\nThe resentment of nobles who didn’t get the prime sightseeing spot they wanted was something to be feared. The negative feelings could build up and become a powerful force of their own, which is where these yōkai come from. Oboroguruma materialized out of the wrath of nobles who lost these carriage fights and were not able to reserve the sightseeing spots that they wanted.\n\n",

It is a type of ikiryō—a spirit of a still-living person which leaves the body to haunt its victim. The magic which summons this spirit, the person who casts the spell, and the family line of that person are all referred to as ichijama. Not only people, but cows, pigs, horses and other livestock, as well as crops can be cursed by an ichijama.\n\nInteractions: An ichijama is summoned by praying to a special doll known as an ichijama butokii. The ichijama butokii is boiled in a pot while reciting the name of the body part which is to be cursed. After the ritual is performed, a spirit which looks exactly like the person casting the spell visits the home of the intended victim. It delivers a gift to its target—usually fruit or vegetables such as bananas, garlic, or wild onions. After receiving the gift, the target develops an unidentifiable sickness in whichever body part was chanted during the spell. If untreated, the victim will die.\n\nOmyōdō did not exist in Okinawa, so this curse could only be overcome with the help of Okinawan magic, by shamans known as yuta. This was accomplished by performing yet another curse. The yuta would bind the victim’s thumbs together and hit them with a nail while chanting bad things about the curse victim. Performing this curse would drive out the ichijama from its victim.\n\nOrigin: The ability to summon an ichijama is a hereditary secret passed down from mother to daughter. Families with such magical power are said to be very beautiful and have a sharp look in their eyes. The ability to use black magic carries a strong social stigma in Okinawa. Marrying into one of these families should be avoided at all costs. But it is difficult to tell; ichijama clans are often careful about hiding their family secret.\n\n",

Sometimes called a raccoon dog in English, the tanuki is in fact a unique species of East Asian canine that resembles a badger or a raccoon. These shy, nocturnal animals can be found on all of the Japanese isles. Tanuki statues are popular decorations in homes and shops. They are beloved not only for their cuteness, but also for the tales of mischief and trickery associated with them.\n\nBehavior: Tanuki possesses powerful magical abilities. They are similar to kitsune in their superb ability to change shape. Tanuki have a jovial nature, and delight in playing tricks on humans.\n\nAside from their powerful ability to change their shape, perhaps the most famous attribute that tanuki possess is their massive, malleable, magical testicles which they can adapt to any need. Their testicles can be used as weapons, drums, fans to keep cool, fishing nets—even umbrellas. Often, tanuki incorporate their testicles into their disguises: the tanuki becoming a shopkeeper and its testicles transforming into the shop; or perhaps a palanquin complete with servants to cart the tanuki from place to place. A famous nursery rhyme about tanuki testicles is learned by children everywhere:\n\nTan tan tanuki no kintama wa/Kaze mo nai no ni/Bura bura\n Tan-tan-tanuki’s balls/Even when there is no wind/They swing, swingInteractions: In the ancient religions of the Japanese isles, tanuki were considered gods and rulers over all things in nature. With the introduction of Buddhism, they gradually lost their status. Like other magical animals, they took on the roles of messengers of the gods and guardians of local areas. While tanuki are not generally feared or considered malicious, they are not entirely harmless either. Like humans, each one is a unique individual. While many tanuki are jovial do-gooders who love the company of humans, some local tales tell of horrible tanuki who snatch humans to eat, or spirit them away to become servants of the gods.\n\nOther forms: The most intelligent and magically adept tanuki have been known to adopt human names and practices, such as gambling, drinking, even administration and religious activities. Many go through their whole lives living among humans without ever being detected. In human form, tanuki have proven to be as corruptible as the humans they emulate. Some tanuki have well-earned reputations as thieves, drunkards, liars, and cheats.\n\nAdditionally, many use their shape-shifting powers to transform into stones, trees, statues, and even ordinary household items in order to play tricks on people. Some even transform into giants and horrible monsters—either to terrorize humans for pleasure, or to scare them away from places they shouldn’t be.\n\n",

Early shikome illustrations have served as the basis for a great number of yōkai which satirize unattractive women, such as ao nyōbo, taka onna, and kerakera onna.\n\nShikome also play a role in Japan’s ancient mythology, where they are known as yomotsu shikome (ugly women of Yomi).\n\nLegends: The widowed god Izanagi grieved for his dead wife Izanami, who had died in childbirth. He journeyed into the underworld to try to bring her back from the dead. Izanagi found her deep in the shadowy land of Yomi. He begged her to return to the surface with him. Izanami sadly explained that she since had already eaten the food of the dead, she could not return. But she would ask if she could at least visit him. She asked Izanagi to wait for her answer, and made him promise not to bring any light into the dark underworld.\n\nIzanagi grew impatient of waiting. Finally, he entered the palace of the dead to look for Izanami. He transformed his comb into a torch so he could see through the dark. When the light fell upon Izanami’s face, he saw that she was horrible to behold. Her flesh was rotting away and she was covered in wriggling maggots. Izanami grew furious at him for breaking his promise. Izanagi was terrified. He fled from the palace. Izanami ordered her servants, the yomotsu shikome, to catch Izanagi.\n\nThe shikome were incredibly fast. As they closed in, Izanagi threw his woven headdress to the floor. It transformed into a vine of grapes. The shikome stopped for a moment to devour the grapes, buying Izanagi some time. The demons quickly devoured the grapes, then resumed their chase. Izanagi broke the teeth off of his comb and scattered them. They turned into bamboo shoots. The shikome devoured these too, buying him just a little more time. At last, he was able to escape to the surface. He rolled a large boulder over the entrance to Yomi, trapping the shikome and his furious wife in the underworld forever.\n\n",

Hakutaku live in remote mountains, and only appear in eras and countries where the ruler of the land is a wise and virtuous leader. They are extremely good omens and symbols of good luck. Hakutaku can speak human languages, and are highly knowledgeable about all things in creation.\n\nInteractions: Because of its incredible knowledge of the various kinds of yokai and monsters, paintings of the hakutaku were very popular in Japan during the Edo period. They were sold and used as good luck charms and as wards against evil spirits, disease, and other yokai. Because the hakutaku knows all, it was believed that evil yokai would stay away from him.\n\nOrigin: The hakutaku, like many other holy beasts, comes from Chinese legends. In China, it is known as the bai ze.\n\nLegends: One of the most famous accounts of a hakutaku comes from the legendary Yellow Emperor (2697–2597 BCE) of China. The emperor was performing an imperial tour of his lands, and in the east near the sea, he climbed a mountain and encountered a hakutaku. The two spoke, and the hakutaku told the emperor that in all of creation there were 11,520 different kinds of yokai. The emperor had his subordinates record everything the hakutaku said, and it was preserved in a volume known as the Hakutaku-zu. This volume recorded each kind of yokai, along with what kind of evils they do, or disasters they bring, as well as how to deal with them — a sort of demonic disaster manual. Unfortunately the Hakutaku-zu was lost long, long ago, and no surviving copies exist.\n\nA legend from Toyama prefecture tells of a Japanese sighting of a hakutaku. It appeared on Mount Tateyama, one of the tallest and holiest mountains in Japan. This creature, called a kutabe in this legend, warned of a deadly plague that would soon sweep through the lands. It told the villagers how to create magical talismans that would protect them from the plague, and they were saved. Since then, the hakutaku has been revered as a symbol of medicine.\n\n",

            "content": "金縛り\nかなしばりTranslation: bound up with metal\n\nAppearance: Kanashibari is the Japanese term for sleep paralysis, a phenomenon when REM sleep overlaps with waking consciousness. The victim’s body is still paralyzed in sleep, but the eyes are open and the mind is half-awake; and the real and dream worlds mix together. Stories about kanashibari go back all the way to ancient times, and it was attributed to a supernatural force enacted upon the body. There are a number of legends about kanashibari, and each one points at a different cause.\n\nOrigin: The most common form of kanashibari comes from possession. When a person is possessed by inugami, kitsune, tanuki, or other kinds of tsukimono, one of the possible symptoms they can develop is immobility or sleep paralysis. This sort of possession could sometimes be overcome if a shugenja — a kind of priest — recited Buddhist sutras to drive out the possessing animal spirit. Once the spirit was driven out, the kanashibari would disappear, and all would be well again.\n\nOther kinds of yokai can inflict kanashibari. The makura-gaeshi, a kind of zashiki-warashi from Ishikawa prefecture, haunts rooms at night, flipping over the pillows of the sleeping inhabitants. Victims sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, feeling a crushing weight on their chest, and find the ghost of a small child sitting on them. This can occur sporadically, or even every night, depending on the mood of the makura-gaeshi. Though not actually harmful, this is a terrifying experience for the victim.\n\nKanashibari can even be caused by humans — usually priests or sorcerers. The tale of Kiyohime features one passage where the jealous princess is chasing after her lover, Anchin. Trying to escape her advances, Anchin asks the priest at a Kumano shrine for help, and they are able to trap Kiyohime in kanashibari, giving Anchin time to flee.\n\nFinally, kanashibari can be caused by ghosts. A famous account comes from a popular ghost story in Iwate prefecture. There are many variations, but generally what happens is this: during the middle of the night, a person wakes up with an ominous, foreboding sense of dread. He (or she) realizes that he can’t move, even though he is wide awake. It feels like powerful arms are gripping him tight, keeping him immobile. Suddenly, an invisible force tugs on his legs and drags him out from under his futon — usually in the direction of an open window, or a river, or some other dangerous place! After a desperate struggle, he finally snaps out of the sleep paralysis, and sees the ghost of a middle aged woman rising up into the ceiling.\n\n",

            "content": "酒吞童子\nしゅてんどうじTranslation: a nickname meaning “little drunkard”\n\nLegends: There are few monsters who are considered among the greatest and most evil yokai in all of Japanese folklore. The dreaded king of the oni, Shuten dōji, is one of them.\n\nShuten dōji was not born an oni. There are many stories about how he came to be, but most of them say that he was originally a human boy who was born over a thousand years ago either in present-day Shiga or Toyama. His mother was a human woman and his father was the great dragon Yamata-no-Orochi. How he changed from boy to demon varies greatly from story to story, but the one popular version goes like this: There was a young boy who was supernaturally strong and abnormally intelligent for his age. Everyone around him constantly called him a demon child due to his incredible strength and wit, and he gradually became terribly anti-social and resentful of others. At age six, even his own mother abandoned him. Orphaned, he became an apprentice priest at Mt. Hiei in Kyoto. Naturally, he was the strongest and smartest of the young acolytes, and he grew resentful of them as well. He slacked off on his studies as a result and got into fights. He also fell into drinking, which was forbidden to monks; however he could out-drink anyone and everyone who was willing to sit down and drink against him. Because of his fondness for alcohol, he became known as Shuten dōji, “the little drunkard.”\n\nOne night there was a festival at the temple, and Shuten dōji showed up very drunk. He put on an oni mask and went around playing pranks on his fellow priests, jumping out from the darkness to scare them and such. At the end of the night, he tried to take off his mask but found he couldn’t — to his horror, it had fused to his body! Ashamed, scared, and scolded by his masters for being drunk, he fled into the mountains where he would no longer have to interact with other humans, whom he saw as weak, foolish, and hypocritical. He lived there on the outskirts of Kyoto for many years, stealing food and alcohol from villagers, and drinking vast quantities of alcohol. His banditry eventually attracted groups of thieves and criminals, who stuck with him loyally and became the foundation for his gang.\n\nLiving in exile, Shuten dōji grew in power and knowledge. He mastered strange, dark magic, and taught it to his thugs. He met another demon child like him, named Ibaraki dōji, who became his chief servant. Over time, the young man and his gang gradually transformed into oni, and eventually he had a whole clan of oni and yokai thugs who prowled the highways, terrorizing the people of Kyoto in a drunken rage. He and his gang eventually settled on Mount Ōe, where, in a dark castle, he plotted to conquer the capital and rule as emperor.\n\nShuten dōji and his gang rampaged through Kyoto, capturing noble virgins, drinking their blood and eating their organs raw. Finally, a band of heroes led by the legendary warrior Minamoto no Yorimitsu assaulted Shuten dōji’s palace, and with the help of some magical poison, were able to assault the oni band during a bout of heavy drinking. They cut off the drunken Shuten dōji’s head, but even after cutting it off, the head continued to bite at Minamoto no Yorimitsu.\n\nBecause the head belonged to an oni and was unholy, it was buried it outside of the city limits, at a mountain pass called Oinosaka. The cup and bottle of poison that Minamoto no Yorimitsu used are said to be kept at Nariai-ji temple in Kyoto.\n\n",

Every so often, in the middle of the night, it crawls out from the ceiling, upside-down, to scare people.\n\nOrigin: In old Japan, the space above the ceiling was connected with a lot of superstitions about dead bodies rolling about or women being confined like prisoners. Tenjō kudari seems to have been something Toriyama inventioned based on those myths. Fittingly, during his time, the phrase “to show someone the ceiling” was a colloquial expression for causing trouble — which tenjō kudari certainly does.\n\nA few possible connections to origins outside of Toriyama’s imagination exist. One involves the story of a yokai that moved into the roof crawlspace of an inn in Yamanashi. During the night, it would descend from the ceiling and snatch up travelers to eat. However, it’s not sure whether this myth inspired Toriyama Sekien or rather was inspired by his work.\n\n",

They have the face of a human with a pointed beak, and the body of a snake with wings, and terrible claws. Their wingspan is 4.8 meters.\n\nBehavior: Itsumade appear in the night sky during times of trouble—such as plagues and disasters, or flying over battlegrounds where many have died. In particular, they fly over places where there is suffering or death, yet little has been done to alleviate the pain of the living or pacify the spirits of the dead. The strange birds fly about in circles all night long, crying out in a terrible voice.\n\nOrigin: Itsumade make their first recorded appearance in the Taiheiki, a fictional history of Japan written in the 14th century. According to the Taiheiki, a terrible plague spread during the fall of 1334. The suffering of the plague victims is what summoned the itsumade.\n\nItsumade’s name is not written in the Taiheiki; it was added later by Toriyama Sekien. He named this yōkai for its horrible cry of “Itsumademo?” which means, “Until when?” The birds appear to be asking those below how long will this suffering go unnoticed. It is thought that the spirits of the dead and suffering form into onryō which take the shape of these birds. They demand recognition of their suffering and torment.\n\nLegends: One night during the fall of 1334, the itsumade suddenly appeared above the hall for state ceremonies, crying out, “Itsumademo? Itsumademo?” Panic erupted amongst the people of the capital. The same creature came back the next night, and every night thereafter. Finally, the imperial court decided that something had to be done. They recalled Minamoto no Yorimasa’s triumph against the nue many years earlier, and decided to summon the warrior Oki no Jirouzaemon Hiroari. Hiroari was an expert archer. He used a signal arrow that let off a loud whistle as it flew, and shot the monster out of the sky. Afterwards, Hiroari was given the name Mayumi, meaning true bow.\n\nMayumi Hiroari went on to become a famous warrior, and settled down in what is now Mayumi, Miyama City, Fukuoka Prefecture, where his grave still stands. The area was renamed in his honor after he died.\n\n",

He lived in a nice house, as was typical of samurai at the time. One day, his wife went to use the bathroom, and something strange happened. While using the toilet, she felt a hand reach up from the darkness and stroke her behind. She told her husband, who suspected the work of a mischievous tanuki or kitsune. Jingobei drew his katana and entered the bathroom. Sure enough, as he stood over the toilet, something moved—an arm, covered in thick, black hair, reached up out of the darkness and began making a stroking motion. With one swing of his sword, Jingobei sliced the hand clean off. He put it into a box.\n\nSeveral days later, three yōkai disguised as priests appeared at Jingobei’s house. Not realizing their true form, Jingobei invited them in. The first priest said, “There is a strange presence in this house…”\n\nJingobei brought out the box and showed them the hand. The second priest said, “This is the hand of a creature known as a kurote who lives in humans’ toilets.”\n\nThe third priest examined the hand closely and snarled, “This is my hand which you cut from my arm!” He immediately transformed into a 9-foot tall, black-haired monster. He snatched the hand away, and then all three priests vanished.\n\nSometime later, while Jingobei was walking home late at night, something like a quilt fell down from the sky on top of him. Wrapped up and unable to move, Jingobei was lifted up seven feet into the air and then violently slammed to the ground. When he came to, Jingobei noticed that the sword he was carrying on his belt—the one which he used to cut off the kurote’s hand—was missing.\n\n",

When people die but do not receive enough memorial prayer, their life energy can transform into this grotesque, bird-like demon. The name onmoraki comes from a play on words emphasizing demonic interference with achieving Buddhist enlightenment. The first part of the name, on, comes from onmyō, the Japanese word for yin and yang. On represents yin, the shadow, the unseen, and hidden, secret things—in this case it refers to demons which live in the shadows and in the hidden parts of the world.

They resemble human women in most ways, although they are hideously ugly to behold. Some have red or yellow eyes, blue skin, sharp horns, long claws, or other supernatural features. They usually dress in rags and wear their hair long and unkempt. They live like savages far from civilization.\n\nBehavior: Kijo refers chiefly to women who have been transformed from humans into horrible monsters—either out of intense jealousy, wicked crimes, or a terrible grudge that twists the soul into pure hatred. These transformed women retreat from common society into more secluded places where they continue to perpetrate their wicked deeds. They can be found living in remote mountain caves, abandoned houses, or along mountain roads where they receive a steady supply of victims. Kijo are stronger than most humans, though their strength pales in comparison to oni. These demonesses excel in magic; they accumulate powerful spells over their long lives. Kijo are capable of bestowing hexes and curses, brewing poisons and potions, and weaving complex illusions. A few kijo dedicate themselves to personal vengeance or some political goal. But most just keep to themselves and go unnoticed by humankind for centuries.\n\nInteractions: Like oni, kijo are the stuff of Japanese legends. Innumerable fairy tales, bedtime stories, kabuki plays, films, and so featuring kijo on have been created to entertain, to caution, and to preach morality. Women who do bad things might turn into kijo, and men who go after unscrupulous women might be heading to their deaths.\n\nOrigin: Kijo is a broad term that in its most general sense encompasses any female demon, just as the term oni can technically refer to any male demon. Indeed, the name kijo is formed simply by combining the two kanji for oni and woman. Though their name might suggest that kijo are the female counterparts to the male oni, there is nothing to support this. Tales show oni working either as tormentors of the damned or as menaces to human society in the living world, but kijo do not seem to have any connection to hell or the afterlife. They work solo, and have their own motives. Further, kijo and oni are not commonly seen together. Little to nothing is known about how either creature reproduces (or if they even do). It is likely that kijo are entirely separate creatures from oni, other than the fact that both are born from corrupted human souls.\n\n",

They work hard to cause their hosts to do evil things.\n\nInteractions: The names of the sanshi are Jōshi, Chūshi, and Geshi, meaning upper worm, middle worm, and lower worm.\n\nJōshi lives in your head and looks like a Taoist wise man. He is responsible for making your eyes grow weak, creating wrinkles, and growing white hairs. Chūshi lives in your torso and looks like a wild beast. He is responsible for damaging internal organs, making you overeat and overdrink, and causing bad dreams. Geshi lives in the lower half of your body and looks like a human foot with a cow’s head. He drains the will and shortens the life of his host.\n\nThe number 60 is an important number in Chinese astrology, and every sixty days the sanshi leave the body to visit the King of Heaven while their host human sleeps. They report their host’s wicked deeds for the year to king. Depending on this report, the King of Heaven shortens each human’s life span by a certain amount.\n\nTo escape the King of Heaven’s sentence, Kōshin practitioners do not sleep every 60th night, so the sanshi are never able to leave the body and give their report. Additionally, spells and charms are chanted to prevent any harm done by the sanshi. The following spell is said to defeat the sanshi’s power:\n\nホウコウシ、ホウジョウシ　メイコシ　シツニュウヨウメイイチュウ　キョリガシン\n\nFinally, if you find yourself drowsy and unable to stay awake, the following spell must be chanted before falling asleep to prevent harm:\n\nシヤムシハ、イネヤサリネヤ　ワガトコヲ　ネタレゾネヌゾ　ネネドネタレルゾ\n\n",

It appears as one or more (up to several hundred) reddish flames which float about in the sky. These supernatural fires are said to be created by tengu.\n\nBehavior: Tengubi descends at night from the mountains to the rivers. Often it starts as a small number of fireballs which split into hundreds of smaller flames. These flames hover above the water for some time, as if dancing. Afterwards, they return to the mountains.\n\nInteractions: In most cases, humans who witness tengubi invariably meet with disaster—usually in the form of a serious illness contracted shortly after the encounter. Because of this, locals who lives in areas where tengubi is common greatly fear this phenomenon. If a local happens to see a tengubi, they will immediately drop prone and hide. Oftentimes they will cover their heads with their shoes or sandals.\n\nOccasionally, tengubi can he helpful to humans. During times of drought, it was common for rice farmers to secretly steal water from their neighbors by redirecting water from the canals into their own fields during the night. This caused a great deal of conflict among the people involved. However, when tengubi appeared above the canals, would-be thieves were thwarted—either out of guilty consciences or because the light from the tengubi made it impossible to sneak around.\n\nOrigin: Tengubi is created by kawa tengu—”river tengu” who prefer the riversides over the deep mountain valleys where tengu normally live. It is used by these tengu to catch fish at night. For this reason it is also known as tengu no gyorō (“tengu fishing”).\n\nToriyama Sekien included this phenomenon in his book Hyakki tsurezure bukuro under the name taimatsu maru (taimatsu meaning “torch,” and maru being a popular suffix for boys’ names). He described it not as a tool for tengu to help with fishing, but as a way for them to hinder and interfere with the religious practices of ascetic monks.\n\nLegends: Long ago, tengubi was frequently seen in the villages of Kasugai City, Aichi Prefecture. One night, a villager was caught out in the mountains in a sudden thunderstorm. It was cold, and too dark to find his way back home, so he took shelter under a tree and shivered. Before long, mysterious fires began appearing around him. Not only did they warm his chilled body up, but they provided enough light for him to find the road and make it safely back to his village.\n\nIt was a common superstition in that village not to go outside of your home on nights when tengubi appeared. If you did, it was said that you would be spirited away into the mountains. One night a particularly foolhardy young man defied the superstition. He walked out of his house, faced the tengubi, and called out, “If you can take me, come and get me!” Suddenly, a large black shape appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the young man. It picked him up and flew away into the mountains. The young man was never seen again.\n\n",

He included it in his collection of tsukumogami Hyakki tsurezure bukuro, dubbing it tenjōname.\n\nLater, this yōkai appeared in a number of other picture scrolls, with the name isogashi appearing next to it. Despite being based on the same picture, tenjōname and isogashi developed into separate yōkai.\n\nAside from paintings, nothing but a name was recorded for isogashi until the Shōwa Period. It does not appear in folklore or legends. Mizuki Shigeru came up with the description of this yōkai as a spirit which possesses humans, and his description stuck.\n\n",

Her skin is dark purple and her face is said to resemble an eggplant with teeth. She haunts Mount Hiei, around the Enryaku-ji temple complex. She is known as one of the “Seven Wonders of Mount Hiei.”\n\nBehavior: Despite her grotesque and frightening appearance, nasu babā is not a wicked yōkai. She spends most of her time lurking in dark rooms around Enryaku-ji or wandering around Mount Hiei, away from prying eyes. However, when there is a disaster at the temple, she warns the people living there by ringing the temple’s bell.\n\nIn 1571, Oda Nobunada attacked Enryaku-ji and set fire to the temple complex. The fleeing monks reported seeing through the flames a disheveled old woman ringing the temple’s bell to alert the mountain to the danger.\n\nInteractions: On the rare occasions that her path crosses with a human’s, she greets them with a big smile. The shock is often enough to cause the human to faint, but nasu babā is able to revive them with her magic and send safely them on their way.\n\nOrigin: Nasu babā was once a human woman. She was a high ranking noble woman who lived hundreds of years ago and served in the imperial court. However, due to some crime she committed (some say that she killed an animal and ate its flesh, others say that she committed a murder) she was damned to go to hell after she died. For the remainder of her life, however, she was repentant of her sins, and asked the buddhas and the priests of Enryaku-ji to forgive her. Therefore, even though her body descended into hell, her spirit was able to remain on Mount Hiei. To this day, out of her gratitude to the buddhas, she comes to warn the temple when disaster strikes.\n\n",

Its leg span is three ri wide–almost twelve kilometers.\n\nBehavior: The most well known tearai oni sighting took place in Sanuki Province (present-day Kagawa Prefecture) during the Edo Period. It was seen straddling the mountains between Takamatsu and Marugame Cities and washing its hands in the bay below.\n\nOrigin: Tearai oni appears in the Edo Period book Ehon hyakumonogatari, which says that its actual name was unknown to anybody, so witnesses just referred to it as the hand washing demon of Sanuki. Despite its name, it is not actually an oni but is rather a type of daidarabotchi. In this case the word oni is just used as a catch-all term for monsters.\n\nThough the term tearai oni doesn’t turn up outside of Ehon hyakumonogatari, other local legends from Kagawa speak of a giant who used to come down from the mountains, straddle the mountains, and scoop up water from the bay with his hands to drink. Giant footprints have also been found high up in the mountains. Its local nickname was kyojin no ojomo, and it has been speculated that it was the same giant as the tearai oni.\n\n",

Rather than the benign and cute azuki arai known throughout the country, this northeastern variation takes the form of a fearsome old hag dressed all in white, singing in a husky, ugly voice. Azuki babā appear only at twilight—particularly on rainy or misty autumn nights. Their song is similar to the azuki arai’s, except that azuki babā follow through on the threat to catch and eat humans.\n\nBehavior: Witnesses of azuki babā describe an eerie, white glow visible through a thick, white mist. From the mist, they hear the husky voice of an old hag singing her ghastly song and counting beans as she washes them in the river with a strainer. Those who don’t turn away at this point never make it back.\n\nInteractions: Azuki babā are rarer than their harmless, bean-washing counterparts. Despite their ferociousness, they are mostly found only in stories used to scare children into behaving properly. Of all the variations of azuki-related yōkai, this one is the most likely to be a shape-shifted evil itachi, tanuki, or kitsune imitating the harmless azuki arai to attract a curious child to catch and eat.\n\n",

They are not particularly cute, and have pudgy, upturned noses.\n\nBehavior: Despite their childish appearance, amefuri kozō are charged with the very important task of causing rainfall. Wherever they go, they cause clouds to form and rain to come down. In ancient China, amefuri kozō were thought to be the servants of the god of rainfall, who is known as Ushi in Japanese.\n\nInteractions: Amefuri kozō are shy and rarely interact directly with people. However, they enjoy stealing people’s umbrellas and wearing them as hats. They then cause rain showers to fall upon their victims.\n\nOrigin: Amefuri kozō became widely known thanks to the printing boom during the Edo period. They were common characters in the cheap, pocket-sized publications sold by street vendors known as kibyōshi, or yellow covers. Kibyōshi were satirical comics, heavy on illustrations, depicting urban life with easy-to-read prose. Amefuri kozō and other priest boy yōkai became popular in these adult-oriented comic books. People enjoyed their grotesque, silly, yet somewhat cute appearance.\n\nLegends: Rain that falls while the sun is out is known in Japan as kitsune no yomeiri—fox weddings.

They are said to dwell in attics or gardens, and are most active at night. Azuki hakari have never been seen directly—only heard. Though similar in name and habit to their azuki-related cousins, azuki hakari have traits distinct enough to classify them as separate yōkai.\n\nBehavior: Azuki hakari appear in homes late at night, after midnight. An encounter usually begins with the sound of heavy footsteps in the space between the attic and the roof. Shortly after, a rhythmic sound like dried azuki beans being scattered can be heard against the windows or sliding doors leading outside. The sound grows progressively louder, and gradually changes into the sound of splashing water, then finally to the sound of geta—Japanese wooden sandals—walking just outside the room. Opening the doors or windows causes the noise to stop, revealing no sign of any creature; nor any beans or puddles or markings\n\nBecause of the difficulty of direct observation of all azuki spirits, it is likely that some of the stories about azuki arai may in fact be about encounters with azuki hakari, especially those which take place near homes or away from rivers.\n\n",

In many cases, the stones cry because they are possessed by the spirit of someone who was murdered and seeks revenge. However, in some cases it is the stone itself that cries and not a person’s spirit haunting it. The most famous yonaki ishi comes from Kakegawa City in Shizuoka Prefecture.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a pregnant woman was walking home through the steep mountains. She had reached the Sayo no Nakayama Pass when she needed to stop for a rest. She leaned against a large round boulder to catch her breath, but suddenly a bandit appeared. He slashed at her with his blade, and would have cut all the way through her if the sword hadn’t also struck the large boulder she was leaning against. The bandit grabbed her purse and fled into the night. The wound was a fatal one—the woman bled to death.\n\nThanks to the blade striking the rock, her baby was not hurt by the attack. It emerged from her body through the stab wound. Although the mother was dead, her soul was so driven by the need to protect her child that it got stuck in the boulder. From then on, every night the rock would wail and cry loudly. This yonaki ishi became known as one of the “Seven Wonders of Shizuoka.”\n\nA priest from a nearby temple heard the crying. When he went to investigate, he discovered the newborn baby lying beside the boulder. The priest took the baby to his temple and raised him, naming him Otohachi. When Otohachi grew up he was apprenticed to a sword sharpener. After many years he became an accomplish sword sharpener as well.\n\nOne day, a samurai appeared before Otohachi and commanded him to repair his chipped katana. Otohachi was surprised by the terrible crack in the blade. The samurai casually explained that the blade had been chipped many years before when he struck a stone in the Sayo no Nakayama Pass. Otohachi realized that this samurai was the bandit who murdered his mother. Otohachi stood up, gave his name, and then took his revenge.\n\n",

People who gaze into an ungaikyō might see a transformed, monstrous version of themselves looking back.\n\nInteractions: An ungaikyō can be used by humans to trap spirits. On the 15th night of the 8th month in the old lunar calendar, water is poured into a crystal dish to reflect the light of the full moon. (In the old days this was a popular way of admiring the reflection of the night sky.) If that water is used to paint the image of a yōkai onto a mirror, that spirit will then inhabit the mirror.\n\nOrigin: Ungaikyō appears in Toriyama Sekien’s book of tsukumogami Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. Sekien based this yōkai on a mirror from an old Chinese myth. That mirror was called shōmakyō (“demon revealing mirror”). It had the ability to expose the true forms of demons masquerading as humans when they were reflected in the mirror. Shōmakyō was used by King Zhou of the Shang dynasty to reveal that his beloved consort Daji was actually a wicked nine-tailed kitsune, intent on runing his kingdom through her evil depravities. Her true form revealed, she fled the country (setting into action a chain of events that would see her eventually wind up in Japan as Tamamo no Mae). Shōmakyō was used time and time again to reveal the true nature of disguised spirits. Sekien postulated that such a mirror might pick up a little of the strangeness of each yōkai and demon it reflected, eventually becoming one itself. Perhaps the countless spirits that is has reflected over the years have slowly gained the ability to manipulate its reflections.\n\nMore recently, ungaikyō has been described simply as a mirror which has transformed into a conscious being. Upon reaching one hundred years of age, the mirror develops a soul and is transformed into a yōkai—a very common theme among tsukumogami.\n\nUngaikyō has also been portrayed as one of the many transformations performed by tanuki. By sucking in large amounts of air and inflating their bellies, a tanuki is able to display a picture on its bare belly similar to a television screen. This portrayal is not rooted in folklore however, but comes from Daiei Films’ 1968-69 yōkai movies. Nonetheless, it has caught on and remains a popular variation of ungaikyō in many productions.\n\n",

They are strong, fast, and ferocious, and can be as menacing to humans as wolves. On the other hand, tamed hainu can also be loyal, loving pets.\n\nOrigin: The hainu legend comes from Chikugo, Fukuoka. It is supposedly buried in a grave at Sōgaku Temple. It is the namesake of the neighborhood where it is located, Hainuzuka (“hainu burial mound”). A stone monument at the temple and a number of bronze statues displayed throughout the city memorialize this local legend. The hainu was even selected as the Chikugo City’s official mascot.\n\nLegends: There are two common versions of the hainu legend—one featuring a good hainu, the other an evil hainu. Both of them take place in the spring of 1587, when the armies of Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Kyūshū with the goal of unifying Japan.\n\nThe evil legend tells that long ago, a winged dog appeared in Chikugo Province. It was incredibly ferocious. It attacked travelers, slaughtered livestock, and came to be greatly feared by the locals. While passing through the area, Hideyoshi’s way was blocked by the hainu. It took a great effort by Hideyoshi and his army to subdue the beast, but finally it was slain. Hideyoshi was so impressed by its cleverness and ferocity that he had the monster buried and erected a mound in its honor.\n\nThe good legend tells that when Hideyoshi was on his campaign, he was accompanied by a fabulous winged dog. The hainu flew around in the sky as it followed its master. Hideyoshi adored the hainu. Sadly, while passing through Chikugo the animal fell sick and died. Hideyoshi was overcome with grief. His retainers saw their general’s sadness and couldn’t stand idly by, so they built a burial mound for the hainu and interred it there.\n\n",

They come in many varieties, but are most commonly depicted with red or blue skin, wild hair, two or more horns, and fang-like tusks. Other variations exist in different colors and with different numbers of horns, eyes, or fingers and toes. They wear loincloths made of the pelts of great beasts. All oni possess extreme strength and constitution, and many of them are accomplished sorcerers. They are ferocious demons, bringers of disaster, spreaders of disease, and punishers of the damned in hell.\n\nBehavior: Oni are born when truly wicked humans die and end up in one of the many Buddhist hells. Transformed into oni, they become the ogreish and brutal servants of Great Lord Enma, ruler of hell. Wielding great iron clubs, they crush and destroy humans solely for enjoyment. An oni’s job is to mete out horrible punishments such as peeling off skins, crushing bones, and rendering other torments too horrible to describe. All these tortures are for wicked sinners—but only those not quite wicked enough to be reborn as oni themselves. Hell is full of oni. They make up the armies of the great generals of the underworld.\n\nOccasionally, when a human is so utterly wicked that his soul is beyond any redemption, he transforms into an oni while still alive. He then remains on earth to terrorize the living. These transformed oni are the ones most legends tell about, and the ones who pose the most danger to humankind.\n\nInteractions: Oni are the stuff of legends and fairy tales. Japanese mythology is full of countless stories of oni encounters with lords and ladies, warriors and rogues. No two stories about oni are exactly alike except for one thing—oni are always the villains of mankind.\n\nOrigin: Originally, all spirits, ghosts, and monsters were known as oni. The root of their name is a word meaning “hidden” or “concealed,” and it was written with the Chinese character for ghost. In the old days of Japan, before the spirits were well-cataloged, oni could refer to almost any supernatural creature—ghosts, obscure gods, large or scary yōkai, even particularly vicious and brutal humans. As the centuries shaped the Japanese language, the definitions we know for the various kinds of monsters gradually came into being. Female demons are not called oni, but are known by another name: kijo.\n\n",

They wear tattered robes and wooden sandals, and carry a cane and sometimes a musical instrument. They appear on rainy nights, loitering about brothels or wandering through red light districts.\n\nInteractions: People who stop ōzatō to ask where they are going receive the same reply: “Always to the brothel, to play my shamisen!”\n\nOrigin: Zatō were a protected class of people, sponsored by the government. Under the shogunate, certain jobs were legally restricted to certain classes. Under this system, the zatō had a monopoly over shamisen and biwa performances, massage, and debt collection. While this system was established as a sort of safety net to ensure that the blind could perform work and earn a living independently, it allowed for massive social stratification among the blind, and heavy corruption existed among the rich and powerful zatō.\n\nŌzatō was invented by Toriyama Sekien for his book Konjaku hyakki shūi. Sekien expressed his distaste for corrupt people—zatō among them—by turning them into yōkai. Apparently he thought that the old zatō hanging around outside of brothels every night were ghastly and sinful, and reminded him of yōkai. Although Sekien doesn’t specifically explain what he had in mind when he created this yōkai, it’s easy to imagine that he was criticizing corrupt debt collectors gathering other people’s money and spending them on carnal pleasures.

This continues with the yōkai leading its victim further and further into the river. Finally, it sneaks up under the unsuspecting human, pulls his legs out from under him, and sends him tumbling into the river. While this is only meant as a prank, some people drown in this manner. This makes kawa akago a fairly dangerous yōkai.\n\nOrigin: Similar yōkai called yama akago (mountain baby) are found in Akita Prefecture (old Dewa Province).

They are large, bipedal felines as large as or larger than a human. They are often accompanied by hellish flames or lightning. They like to appear during rainy or stormy weather, and most often during the night. Their name sometimes causes confusion with other yokai; while their name means “fire cart,” they do not use vehicles of any kind.\n\nInteractions: Kasha, being bake-neko, often live among humans, disguised as ordinary house cats or strays. However, they reveal their true forms during funeral services, when they leap down from rooftops to snatch corpses out of their coffins. Kasha are occasionally employed as messengers or servants of hell, in which case they are tasked with collecting the corpses of wicked humans spiriting them off to hell for punishment. Other times, they steal corpses for their own uses — either to animate as puppets or to eat.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to retrieve a person’s remains after they have been snatched by a kasha. This makes passing on to the next life difficult. The best defense is to be prepared; temples in areas where kasha are said to prowl have devised unique ways of defending against these monster cats. In Yamagata, clever priests have taken to holding two funeral ceremonies for the deceased. The first ceremony is a fake — the casket is filled only with rocks, so if a kasha comes for the body it will end up with nothing. The real ceremony takes place afterwards, when the risk of a kasha encounter is lessened. In Ehime, a head shaving razor may be placed on top of the coffin as against kasha. In Miyazaki, priests chant, “baku ni wa kuwasen” and “kasha ni wa kuwasen” (“don’t be eaten by a baku, don’t be eaten by a kasha”) twice times in front of the funeral procession in order to keeps evil spirits away. In Okayama, the priests play a myōhachi — a type of cymbal used in religious ceremonies — in order to keep the kasha away.\n\nOrigin: Kasha were once ordinary house cats. Like other animals, as they age in years and their tails grow longer, cats begin to develop magical powers. Some turn into bake-neko, more powerful cats turn into neko-mata, and beyond that some turn into kasha. Fear of such demonic cats has long existed in Japan, and since ancient times, folk wisdom tells us, “Don’t let cats near dead bodies,” and, “If a cat jumps over the coffin, the corpse inside the coffin will rise.” Fears such as these have given rise to superstitious traditions such as cutting a cat’s tail short in order to prevent it from learning magic.\n\n",

It appears late at night near riverbanks. It has the body of a bird, and its face is somewhat dog-like. It is a type of hi-no-tama, or fireball yokai. It does very little except for float about aimlessly, which is how it got its name.\n\nOrigin: Furaribi are created from the remains of a soul which has not properly passed on to the next life. This is most often due to not receiving proper ceremonial services after dying. In Japan there are a number of important ceremonies performed at fixed intervals which occur for many years after someone’s death — missing even one of these could cause a soul to become lost and be unable to rest. Furaru-bi is one of these lost souls.\n\nLegends: In the late 16th century, Toyama was ruled by a samurai named Sassa Narimasa. Narimasa kept a very beautiful concubine named Sayuri in his household. Sayuri was not well liked by the female servants and other women in Sassa Narimasa’s household. They were jealous of her beauty and of Narimasa’s love for her. One day, these women conspired against Sayuri and started a rumor that she had been unfaithful to Narimasa with one of his own men. Narimasa flew in a fit of jealous rage, murdered Sayuri, then took her body down to the Jinzū river. He hung her corpse from a tree and proceeded to carve it into pieces with his sword. Then he captured Sayuri’s entire extended family — 18 people in all — and executed them in the same manner. Afterwards, their tortured souls aimlessly wandered the riverbanks every night as furaribi.\n\nIt is said if you go down to the riverside and call out, “Sayuri, Sayuri!” late at night, the floating, severed head of a woman will appear, pulling and tearing at her hair in a vengeful fury. As for Sassa Narimasa, he was later defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Some have attributed his defeat by Hideyoshi to the vengeful curse of Sayuri’s ghost.\n\n",

They appear in numerous stories from the Edo period, where they are described as enormous fish or monstrous serpents of some kind. Their bodies are covered in a slippery oil, which sheds as they swim the ocean.\n\nInteractions: When an ikuchi’s path crosses a boat’s, the sea monster envelopes the boat in its tentacle-like body. It slithers over the sides and across the deck, slowly sliding its whole body over the boat. Ikuchi are so long—many kilometers, by some accounts—that it can take hours for an entire one to slither over a boat. On a few occasions, boats have been tangled up in this monster for days. During this time, sailors must constantly bail the monster’s oily slime off of the deck to avoid being capsized by the heavy goo.\n\nOrigin: An ikuchi is depicted in Toriyama Sekien’s bestiary Konjaku Hyakki Shūi, where it is called ayakashi. This yōkai is often referred to by that name. Ayakashi is more commonly used as a term for other strange creatures and supernatural phenomena and has nothing in particular to do with ikuchi. Toriyama Sekien may have just been listing the ikuchi as an example of an ayakashi. For whatever reason the name stuck.\n\n",

In addition, this mischievous yokai chews the scalp of a person good enough to carry it, further adding to his misery. In order to protect against the head-chewing that obariyon inflict, some villages developed a custom of wearing metal bowls on their heads for protection.\n\nInteractions: According to some tales, as the obariyon becomes heavier and heavier, it eventually crushes its victim under its weight. However, more commonly, when a person has dutifully carried the obariyon the whole way home, he or she finds that the strange burden was a sack of money all along, and becomes incredibly rich.\n\nOrigin: The name obariyon comes from a phrase in local Niigata dialect meaning “give me a piggyback ride!” Differences in local dialects are reflected in the many different local names for this spirit. Though its name varies from place to place, it is always a local variant for a childish request to be carried piggyback style.\n\nAlthough the exact origins of this particular creature are unclear, folk tales about yokai which demand to be carried or cared for are quite common across Japan. There is a recurring theme among folk tales that those who persevere when dealing with children will prosper. Just as those who put up with the strange demands of the obariyon may find themselves blessed with a bag of gold, those who manage to deal with the demands of raising young children will eventually reap treasures beyond belief. Obariyon is probably a direct metaphor about child-rearing. While the demands of the obariyon may be selfish and extremely burdensome, those who are willing to put up with it for the entire journey find the payoff was well worth the investment.\n\n",

They look like oni, with bright red or blue skin, wild hair and eyes, large mouths full of sharp teeth, and often have horns sprouting from their forehead. They wear straw leggings and raincoats, and carry large blades.\n\nInteractions: Once a year, during koshōgatsu—the first full moon of the New Year—the namahage descend from the mountains to scare villagers. They go from door to and brandish their knives, saying things like, “Any bad kids here?” They particularly enjoy scaring small children and new brides. Despite their ferocious appearance and behavior, they are actually well-meaning yōkai. They are sent down from the mountain as messengers of the gods to warn and chastise those who have been lazy or wicked.\n\nOrigin: The name namahage comes from another taunt the namahage use: “Have your blisters peeled yet?” In the cold winter months, a lazy person who spent all of his or her time in front of the fireplace would get blisters from being too close to the heat for too long. Namomi is a regional name for these heat blisters, and hagu means to peel. The combination of those words became namahage.\n\nToday, the namahage play a major part in New Year’s festivities in Akita Prefecture (old Dewa Province). Villagers dress up in straw raincoats and leggings, don oni masks, and wield large knives. They go from house to house and play the part of namahage. Residents visited by these namahage give presents such as mochi to their “guests,” while the namahage chastise kids and warn them to be good. Newlywed couples are also harassed by these namahage. They are expected to give an account of all of the evil deeds they did during their first year together, as well as serve sake and food to the namahage before sending them off.\n\nWhile the name namahage is unique to Akita Prefecture, very similar yōkai are known by many different local names in neighboring regions: in Yamagata Prefecture they are known as amahage, in Ishikawa Prefecture they are known as amamehagi, and in Fukui Prefecture they are known as appossha.\n\n",

It can also appear as a chicken, but does not remain in this form for long. They are created out of the ghosts of old women who were caught stealing oil and died of shame.\n\nBehavior: Ubagabi have the uncanny ability to fly long distances — up to 4 kilometers — in the blink of an eye. Occasionally they graze a person’s shoulder and then continue off into the darkness. The unfortunate people whom they bounce off of invariably end up dying somehow within three years. However, if one is quick enough and shouts, “Abura-sashi!” (oil thief) just as an ubagabi comes flying towards him or her, the yokai will vanish. The shame at being called out as an oil thief is too much to bear even in death, apparently.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Osaka there lived an old woman who was very poor. In order to make ends meet, she resorted to stealing oil from the lamps at Hiraoka shrine — a terrible crime in an age when oil was so rare and precious. Eventually she was caught by the shrine’s priests and her crime was exposed. From then on, the people of her village shunned her, and would shout out at her for being an oil thief. So great was the old woman’s shame that she went to the pond behind the shrine and committed suicide. Such unclean deaths never turn out well, and instead of dying properly she turned into an yokai. To this day, the pond behind Hiraoka shrine is known by locals as “Ubagabi-ike” (the pond of the ubagabi).\n\n",

Like any tool used for many years, a broom which reaches a very old age becomes a perfect home for a spirit — perhaps even more so in the case of a hahakigami because of the ritual nature of its origin.\n\nHahakigami are used also as magical charms for safe and quick childbirth. Because brooms are used to “sweep out” evil energy, a hahakigami acts as a sort of totem to “sweep out” the baby from its mother safely. They are also used as charms to keep guests from overstaying their visit. Anyone who has stayed beyond their welcome might also be “swept out” by the power of the hahakigami.\n\n",

It has bright red eyes and a red belly. The beast is so large that its body covers the distance of eight valleys and eight hills. Fir and cypress trees grow on its back, and its body is covered in moss.\n\nOrigin: Yamata no Orochi appears in the earliest written Japanese documents, the Kojiki and the Nihongi. Without a doubt, the legend goes back even farther into pre-history.\n\nLegends: Ages ago, the storm god, Susanoo, was thrown out of heaven and descended to earth at Mount Torikama near the Hi River in Izumo Province. There, he came upon an elderly couple of gods named Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi, who were weeping. When Susanoo asked why they were crying, they explained that they once had eight daughters, but every year the eight-headed-eight-tailed serpent Yamata no Orochi demanded one as a sacrifice. They were now down to their eighth and final daughter, Kushinada hime. Soon it would be time for Yamata no Orochi to demand a sacrifice.\n\nSusanoo explained that he was the elder brother of the sun goddess Amaterasu, and offered to slay the beast in return for Kushinada hime’s hand in marriage. The elderly couple agreed, and Susanoo set in motion his plan to defeat the serpent.\n\nFirst, Susanoo transformed Kushinada hime into a comb, which he placed in his hair. Then, he had Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi build a large fence with eight gates. On each gate they raised a platform and on each platform they placed a vat. They poured extremely strong sake into each vat. When this was finished, everyone waited for the serpent to arrive.\n\nWhen Yamata no Orochi appeared, the great serpent slithered into the fence and noticed the powerful sake. It dipped its eight heads into the vats and drank the alcohol. Soon, the monster fell into a deep, drunken sleep. Susanoo used this chance to make his attack. He sliced the enormous beast into tiny pieces with his sword. The carnage was so great that the Hi River flowed with blood. When Susanoo had cut the creature down to its fourth tail, his sword shattered into pieces. Examining the part of Yamata no Orochi’s tail which broke his sword, Susanoo discovered another sword within the creature’s flesh: the legendary katana Murakumo (later known as Kusanagi) no Tsurugi.\n\nSusanoo eventually offered Murakumo as a gift to his sister Amaterasu and was allowed to return to heaven. The sword was passed down through the generations in the imperial line of Japan. It is one of the three pieces of imperial regalia, along with the mirror Yata no Kagami and the jewel Yasakani no Magatama. Today, the sword which came from Yamata no Orochi’s tail is said to be safeguarded in the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya.\n\n",

They are particularly skilled at shape-changing and accurately copying sounds. Kawauso love alcohol, and are usually only seen in human areas trying to acquire sake. They are playful yōkai, well known for their tricks and mischief, but rarely dangerous.\n\nInteractions: Kawauso are fond of playing pranks on humans, especially by mimicking sounds and words. They enjoy calling out human names or random words at strangers walking in the street and watching their confused reactions. They are fond of magically snuffing out lanterns in the night and leaving travelers stranded in the dark. Kawauso sometimes even transform into beautiful young women and try to seduce young men—only to run away laughing when the men take the hook.\n\nOccasionally, kawauso commit more violent deeds.

They are small and ugly, resembling a monkey. Their hair is said to grow in backwards, and they have two tongues: one red and one white. They are sometimes born from pregnant mothers instead of human babies.\n\nBehavior: When a kekkai emerges, covered in blood and amniotic fluid, it quickly scampers away from its mother and tries to escape. This is most often accomplished through the irori, or earthen hearth, a common feature in old country houses. It either burrows down beneath the floorboards, or climbs up the long pothook which hangs above the irori and flees. If the kekkai is able to escape, it will return later to kill its mother while. It does this by burrowing up through the floorboards and into its sleeping mother, tearing her apart.\n\nInteractions: A few traditional precautions exist to protect against kekkai. The most important is preparation. A large shamoji—a spatula—is placed by the irori. When the kekkai tries to climb up the pothook, it must be swatted down and caught before it has a chance to escape.\n\nAnother common precaution is to surround the floor around the mother with byōbu—folding screens—to prevent a kekkai from escaping. This practice is the source of a play on words surrounding this yōkai’s name: the byōbu creates a spiritual barrier, or kekkai (結界), which prevents the kekkai from escaping.\n\nOrigin: Kekkai are almost certainly a way to explain the dangers surrounding childbirth and the existence of birth defects. Before modern medicine was invented, death from complications relating to childbirth was not uncommon. A grieving family might be easily convinced that a mother’s death was caused by some evil spirit—some kind of spiritual punishment for the family’s sins. Similarly, it is not hard to imagine how earlier cultures might have seen premature, stillborn, or deformed babies as monsters. Referring to them as yōkai may have been an attempt to understand the unknown and unexplainable.\n\n",

Her hunters returned triumphantly, bearing her body to the capital. Her spirit, however, attached itself to a large boulder near where she fell. It continued to kill long after her death. Any living thing that wandered close enough to the stone died instantly. Sesshō seki remained a deadly landmark until 1385 CE, when Tamamo no Mae’s spirit was put to rest once and for all.\n\nLegends: One day, a high priest named Gennō was traveling through Shimotsuke Province when he noticed a peculiar sight—the birds in the air fell to their deaths whenever they passed over a certain boulder in the plain of Nasuno. At the base of the stone was a pile of dead birds. Gennō wondered what could cause such a phenomenon. Not long afterwards, a local woman appeared near the priest, and he asked her about the stone.\n\nThe woman explained that Sesshō seki was haunted by the spirit of Tamamo no Mae. She told him the story of the fox courtesan, and then vanished. Gennō realized that the woman had been the ghost of the infamous kitsune. He performed a Buddhist memorial service over the stone, and suddenly Tamamo no Mae’s spirit reappeared and confessed all of her sins, going back thousands of years all the way to India and China. After hearing Gennō’s pure words and Buddhist teachings, Tamamo no Mae repented all of her evils and swore never again to do wrong, and then disappeared. Her spirit, exorcised from the rock, never harmed anyone again.\n\nGennō—whose name means hammer—hit the rock and it burst into many pieces. The pieces flew all across Japan, where many of them remain today. The base of the rock still stands in Nasu, Tochigi. Other chunks flew to Okayama, Niigata, Hiroshima, and Ōita where they were enshrined. Smaller fragments landed in present-day Fukui, Gifu, Nagano, Gunma, and parts of Shikoku, where they were picked up and used as magical amulets to perform charms or curses.\n\n",

Nopperabō usually appear in the guise of a man or a woman with his or her back turned towards the observer. When approached, the yōkai turns around and reveals its terrifying true form. To maximize the effect, they often appear with a face at first, and then wipe their face off dramatically with their hand at the most opportune time. Nopperabō revel in the terror they inflict upon their unsuspecting victims.\n\nNopperabō often work together in groups to scare one individual. As their victim runs away in a panic from the first nopperabō, he runs into another person who asks him what is wrong. When the victim explains what he saw, this person replies, “Oh, you mean like this?” and wipes his face away exactly like the first nopperabō.

Her story takes place during Obon, when the dead are believed to return to the land of the living. Otsuyu’s story is rare among Japanese ghost stories, as her tale is one of love rather than of vengeance.\n\nLegends: Long ago lived a man named Ogiwara Shinnojō, who was recently widowed. On the first night of Obon, Ogiwara saw a beautiful woman and her servant walking down the street, carrying a lantern with a peony motif. Ogiwara was instantly smitten with the beautiful woman and invited her into his home. Her name was Otsuyu. That night they made love. Otsuyu stayed with Ogiwara until long after the moon had set and the lamplight had grown faint, when she reluctantly bid him farewell and left into the early morning.\n\nTo Ogiwara’s delight, Otsuyu and her servant returned the following evening, carrying the same peony lantern. Ogiwara fell deeply in love with Otsuyu. He quickly lost interest in seeing anybody but her. Ogiwara no longer left his house, and stopped taking care of himself. Night after night, Otsuyu visited Ogiwara’s house. Each night they made love, and each night she left before dawn.\n\nTwenty days passed. Ogiwara’s neighbors began to grow concerned for him. Next door to Ogiwara lived a wise old man. One night, the old man heard laughing and singing coming from next door. He peeked through a hole in Ogiwara’s wall. However, instead of a beautiful woman, he saw Ogiwara entwined in the boney arms of a skeleton. When Ogiwara spoke, the skeleton nodded its head and moved its arms and legs. When the skeleton’s jaw opened, a haunting voice came from where its mouth should have been. The old man was horrified.\n\nAs soon as day came, the old man called for Ogiwara. He warned Ogiwara that Otsuyu was really a ghost, and told him to go to a temple at once. Ogiwara heeded the old man’s advice. At the temple, Ogiwara discovered Otsuyu’s grave, with her old and tattered peony lantern draped across it. The priest warned Ogiwara that he must resist Otsuyu, and gave him a magical charm to place on his house, which would keep him safe from the ghost. Ogiwara rushed home and placed the charm on his door. The charm worked perfectly, and Otsuyu no longer came to visit Ogiwara.\n\nAlthough he was safe, Ogiwara became despondent. He missed Otsuyu dearly. One night, days after her last visit, Ogiwara became drunk. He carelessly wandered to the temple where he discovered Otsuyu’s grave. At the temple gate, Otsuyu appeared to him, and led him to her home: her coffin. Later, when Ogiwara had been missing for some time, the priest opened up Otsuyu’s grave. Inside was the dead body of Ogiwara, wrapped up in the boney arms of a human skeleton.\n\n",

She appears outside of houses where tragedy has struck, attracted by the sadness of those within. She remains outside of the house, weeping loudly all night long. Although it appears that yonaki babā are sharing in the sadness of others, it is sometimes said that they actually weep out of scorn, mocking those who are truly sad.\n\nInteractions: Yonaki babā’s weeping is contagious; those who hear her cannot help but to weep as well. She may return to the same house over and over for many nights. Families which are visited by a yonaki babā night after night invariably fall into ruin.\n\nOrigin: Yonaki babā’s behavior is similar to that of a class of spirits called yakubyō gami—minor deities and spirits which bring sickness and disaster wherever they go. Before modern medicine, plagues and natural disasters were often thought to be the works of these spirits. Because repeated yonaki babā appearances are often precursors to the ruin of an entire family, it has been suggested that she may be a kind of yakubyō gami.\n\nConversely, it has also been suggested the yonaki babā’s arrival may be a divine signal that disaster is near.

Along with Oiwa and Otsuyu, Okiku’s tale is one of the Nihon san dai kaidan—Japan’s Big Three Ghost Stories. Her story has been retold countless times in folk tales, puppet theater, kabuki, film, and manga. Though the general outline of her story remains the same, the names, locations, and surrounding details vary quite a bit from telling to telling. The most famous version of her story is called Banchō sarayashiki—”The Dish Manor at Banchō.” It takes place in Himeji, present-day Hyōgo Prefecture.\n\nLegends: Long ago, there was a woman named Okiku who worked as a dishwashing servant at Himeji Castle. Okiku was very beautiful, and it was not long before she caught the eye of one of her master’s retainers, a samurai named Aoyama. Aoyama tried many times to seduce Okiku, but each time she rejected his advances.\n\nEventually, Aoyama grew impatient with Okiku and decided to trick her into becoming his lover. In the castle there was a set of ten very expensive dishes. Aoyama hid one of the them, and then called for Okiku. He told her one of his master’s fine dishes was missing, and demanded to know where it was. Okiku became frightened. Losing one of her lord’s prized dishes was a crime punishable by death. She counted the dishes, “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” She recounted them against and again. Each time she came up one short. Okiku was distraught.\n\nAoyama told Okiku that he would overlook her mistake, and tell his master that it wasn’t Okiku who lost the dish—but only if she would become his mistress. Though Okiku wanted to live, she once again refused Aoyama. This time the samurai became furious. He ordered his servants to beat Okiku with a wooden sword. Afterwards, he had her tied up and suspended over the castle well. He tortured Okiku, repeatedly dunking her into the well, only to pull her back out of the water and beat her himself. Aoyama demanded one last time that Okiku become his mistress. She refused. So Aoyama struck her violently with his sword and dropped her body down into the well.\n\nNot long after, Okiku’s ghost was seen wandering the castle grounds. Night after night, she would rise from the well and enter her master’s house, searching for the missing dish. She would count the plates: “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” After counting the ninth plate, she would let out a blood curdling scream that could be heard throughout the castle. She tormented Aoyama in this way, every night, robbing him of his rest. Those who heard part of Okiku’s counting became very sick. Those unlucky enough to hear her count all the way to nine died shortly after.\n\nFinally, the lord of the castle decided that something had to be done about Okiku’s ghost. He called a priest, and asked him to pray for her and exercise her spirit. The priest waited in the garden all night, chanting suttras. One again, Okiku’s ghost rose out of the well. She began to count the dishes: “One… two… three… four… five… six… seven… eight… nine…” As soon as Okiku counted the ninth dish, and before she could scream, the priest shouted out: “TEN!” Okiku’s ghost appeared relieved that someone had found the missing dish. From then on, she never haunted the castle again.\n\n",

            "content": "お岩\nおいわTranslation: a girls’ name meaning “rock”\n\nAppearance: Oiwa is the tragic and terrifying onryō from Yotsuya kaidan—”the ghost story of Yotsuya.” Along with Okiku and Otsuyu, she is one of the Nihon san dai kaidan—Japan’s Big Three Ghost Stories. Oiwa’s story is based on real people who lived in 17th century Edo. Their story was dramatized in the 1825 kabuki play Tōkaidō yotsuya kaidan, which became very popular and cemented Oiwa’s place as Japan’s most famous ghost. Countless variations and adaptations of her tale followed.\n\nThe real Oiwa died in 1636. It is rumored that her onryō still haunts the places she lived as well as those who perform her story. Mysterious disasters and deaths occurring around a number of productions (including theater, film, and television adaptations) have been blamed on the curse of Oiwa’s ghost. There have been numerous attempts to appease her angry spirit.  A small shrine and a temple dedicated to Oiwa were erected on the ruins of her family’s house in Yotsuya. After a fire destroyed the shrine in 1879, Oiwa’s shrine was moved to another part of Tōkyo. The shrine was again destroyed in the firebombings of World War 2. After the war, her new shrine as well as the original location in Yotsuya were both rebuilt. A gravestone at Myōgyōji in Sugamo, Tokyo is widely believed to be Oiwa’s actual grave. It is customary for actors and crews putting on a production of Yotsuya kaidan to visit Oiwa’s grave to pay their respects.\n\nLegends: Oiwa was married to samurai named Iemon. It was not a happy marriage, for Iemon was a wasteful man and a thief. One day, Oiwa decided to leave her husband and return to her family home. Iemon followed after her, but was stopped by Oiwa’s father, Yotsuya Samon. Samon knew of Iemon’s misdeeds—that he had stolen money from his employer—and he demanded that Iemon divorce Oiwa. Iemon drew his sword and murdered Samon. Iemon returned to Oiwa and lied that a stranger had killed her father on the road. He begged her to reconcile, and he promised to avenge her father’s murder.\n\nSome time after that, Oiwa became pregnant and bore Iemon a son. Times were hard. They had little money. Oiwa became sickly after giving birth, and Iemon grew resentful of Oiwa. Next to their home lived a rich doctor named Itō Kihei. He had a beautiful granddaughter named Oume. Oume was instantly attracted to Iemon, and wanted to marry him. The doctor loved his granddaughter and conspired to help her marry Iemon. He prescribed an ointment for Oiwa to help her recover from her sickness. In reality, it was a poison which horribly disfigured her face. Seeing Oiwa’s scarred face, Iemon’s resentment turned into hatred. Afterwards, Kihei suggested that Iemon divorce Oiwa and marry his granddaughter instead; if he were to marry Oume, all of the wealth of the Itō family could be his to inherit!. Iemon was so disgusted by Oiwa’s face, and Oume was so young and attractive, that he agreed. Iemon began pawning Oiwa’s possessions, her kimono, her clothes—even their son’s clothes—to have enough money to marry Oume. Because he needed a legitimate reason to divorce his wife, Iemon hired his friend Takuetsu to rape Oiwa so that he could accuse her of infidelity.\n\nOn a prearranged night, when Iemon was out of the house, Takuetsu entered and approached Oiwa. Upon seeing her face, he was so frightened that he abandoned his orders. Takuetsu explained Iemon’s plan to Oiwa, and then showed her a mirror. Oiwa had not known what the ointment had done to her face. When she saw her reflection, she was horrified. She tried to cover the disfigurement by brushing her hair over it, but when she touched her hair, it fell out in large, bloody clumps. Oiwa went mad. She grabbed a nearby sword and punctured her own throat. As Oiwa lay on the floor bleeding to death, she repeatedly cursed Iemon’s name until she could breathe no more.\n\nOiwas’ body was discovered by Iemon’s servant Kohei. When Kohei delivered the news to Iemon, instead of become upset, Iemon was overjoyed. Kohei became suspicious of Iemon, but before he could do anything, Iemon murdered Kohei. He nailed Kohei’s and Oiwa’s bodies to a door, and disposed of them in a river. Afterwards, he made up a lie that Kohei and Oiwa had been sleeping together. He was finally free to marry Oume.\n\nOiwa’s curse did not wait long to take effect. On his wedding night to Oume, Iyemon had trouble sleeping. He rolled over in bed and saw, right next to his face, the horrible, disfigured face of Oiwa’s ghost! He grabbed his sword and slashed out at the ghost. Just then, the illusion ended, and Iemon saw that it was not Oiwa he had cut, but Oume. His new bride lay dead on the floor. Terrified, Iemon ran next door to seek his new father in law’s help. However, when he got to the Itō house, he was confronted by the ghost of the murdered Kohei. Once again Iemon slashed with his sword, but no sooner had he done so than the illusion ended and he saw Itō Kihei’s slain body lying on the floor.\n\nAfterwards, Iemon fled into the night, but Oiwa’s onryō pursued him. Everywhere he went, Oiwa’s ghost was there. Her ruined face haunted his dreams. Her terrible voice cried out to him for vengeance. She even appeared to him in the paper lanterns that lit his way. Eventually, Iemon ran into the mountains, where he hid in an isolated cabin. But Oiwa followed him there too. Haunted by Oiwa’s ghost, no longer able to tell nightmare from reality, Iemon descended into madness.\n\n",

            "content": "累\nかさねTranslation: a girls’ name meaning “to pile up; to overlap; to add on;” an alternate reading of the kanji for her original name: Rui\n\nAppearance: Kasane is the ghost from Kasane ga fuchi—The Pool of Kasane. It is based on true events which happened in the 17th century in what is now Ibaraki Prefecture, although the story has changed quite a bit from the original incident. Her tale is one of the most famous Edo period ghost stories, and she is often held up with Oiwa and Okiku as a prime example of the grudge-bearing Japanese woman ghost. Her story was later adapted into rakugo and kabuki theater, as well as numerous films.\n\nLegends: Long ago in the village of Hanyū in Shimosa Provence lived a farmer named Yoemon and his wife Osugi. Osugi had a child from a previous relationship. The child’s name was Suke, and he was terribly ugly. His face was disfigured and his leg was malformed. Yoemon hated Suke. One day, Yoemon decided to dispose of Suke. While crossing a bridge over a deep pool, Yoemon knocked Suki into the pool. Suke was unable to swim, and drowned.\n\nThe following year, Yoemon and Osugi had a baby girl. They named her Rui. Rui looked so much like her half-brother Suke did that the villagers all believed she was haunted by his spirit. Instead of Rui, they referred to her as Kasane—an alternate reading of her name which implied that the ugly Suke had been born once again in her.\n\nBoth of Kasane’s parents died while she was young, and so she lived alone. She became very sick, when a wandering stranger named Yagorō came to her house and nursed her back to health. Out of gratitude, Kasane offered to marry Yagorō and make him the inheritor of her father’s property. Although Yagorō found Kasane repulsive, he wanted her land and inheritance, and so he agreed to marry her.\n\nNot long after they were married, Yagorō had had enough of Kasane’s ugliness. He took her out to their fields to collect beans. On the way home made Kasane carry all of the beans herself, so that she could barely walk. Just as they were crossing the pool, Yagorō pushed the overburdened Kasane into the water. Yagorō jumped in after her. He stepped on her chest, pinning her to the riverbed. He crushed and squeezed the air out of her lungs. He shoved rocks and river sand into her mouth. He stabbed her eyes with his thumbs. Then he wrung her neck until she could struggle no longer. Several townspeople witnessed Yagorō murder Kasane, but nobody moved to help her. After all, she was so ugly—there seemed to be an unspoken agreement to just leave it be.\n\nYagorō continued on as if nothing was different, living in Kasane’s home and maintaining her family’s lands. He remarried very quickly, and for a while was happy. However, Yagorō’s new wife died suddenly, not long after they were married. Yagorō remarried again, and again his wife died suddenly. This happened over and over again. When Yagorō had remarried six times, his wife managed to survive long enough to bear him a daughter. They named their daughter Kiku, and for a while they were happy.\n\nWhen Kiku was thirteen, Yagorō’s sixth wife died. Yagorō married Kiku to a man named Kingorō and named him the successor to the Yoemon family. All of a sudden Kiku became extremely sick and collapsed to the floor. Foaming and frothing at the mouth, tears streaming from her eyes, Kiku cried that she couldn’t bear the pain. She begged for someone to help her. Suddenly, a different voice came forth from her body:\n\n“I am not Kiku! I am your wife! The wife you murdered! You overburdened me, you threw me into the pool, you crushed me and made me drown! Don’t tell me you don’t remember me! I cursed you and all six of your wives! I am the one who killed them! I am Kasane!”\n\nKingorō fled the village, never to return. Kiku’s body stood up and lunged at Yagorō, but he managed to escape to the village temple. Yagorō told everyone that he had no idea what Kiku was saying; that he would never murder his own wife. The villagers, wanting to save poor Kiku, dragged Yagorō out from the temple to confront Kasane. Even as Kasane’s spirit threatened and cursed Yagorō, he defiantly proclaimed his innocence. Kasane’s spirit began naming and cursing the villagers who witnessed her murder and yet did nothing. Finally Yagorō and the others confessed their crime. Rui was such an unattractive and unpleasant person that the whole village had neglected her. Though Yagorō had performed the deed, the whole village was guilty of her murder. The villagers who didn’t witness the murder, but never bothered to ask about Rui were partially responsible too. It was their fault that Rui’s rage had created this ghost, and it was their fault that poor Kiku was suffering.\n\nKasane continued: “All of your ancestors are here with me in Hell!” She then proceeded to name each of their ancestors, and list their crimes. Then Kasane listed all of the crimes of the living villagers. The entire village’s pride was shattered as their sins were made public. Kasane demanded that the villagers hold a lavish memorial service and erect a beautiful stone buddha in her honor to end her suffering. However, the villagers balked at the cost to cover such a funeral. Kasane told them, “My father owned many farms around here. Sell them, and use the money to perform the services!” The villagers confessed to Kasane that her family’s lands had already been sold and distributed. Kasane’s wrath exploded. Kiku’s body twisted and floated high up into the air, and the poor girl lost consciousness.\n\nWord of Kiku’s possession and Kasane’s curse spread far and wide. It caught the ear of a traveling priest, Saint Yūten. Yūten visited the Yoemon household to offer his prayers and try to save Kiku. He chanted the sutras and prayed and prayed with all his effort, but it had no effect. Kasane’s grudge was too powerful. Kasane’s voice taunted Yūten from Kiku’s mouth. Yūten then tried to have Kiku recite the prayers, but Kasane’s spirit interrupted and Kiku was unable to speak. Finally, Yūten grabbed Kiku’s hair with all his strength, forcing her face down onto the floor. He make Kiku bow, and demanded that she pray. Kiku was finally able to recite the sutra, and suddenly the spirit of Kasane left from her body. She was saved.\n\nAs Saint Yūten was preparing to leave Hanyū, Yagorō suddenly came to him with dire news: Kiku’s possession had returned. Yūten once again traveled to the Yoemon household, this time determined to subdue the curse no matter what the cost. When he encountered Kiku, he grabbed her hair and with all of his strength, forced her down onto the floor. As he held her down, demanding she pray, Kiku’s voice could be heard faintly mumbling. Yūten bent down close to her mouth and and listened. Then he turned to Yagorō: “Does the name Suke mean anything to you?”\n\nYagorō had never heard of Suke, nor had anybody else present. Saint Yūten asked the villagers, and finally an elderly man came forward. “Some sixty years ago there was a rumor that the first Yoemon’s wife had a son who was murdered and thrown into the pool. I think his name was Suke.”\n\n“Are you Suke?” Saint Yūten asked Kiku. Kiku’s voice replied, “Yes. When you saved Rui you left me behind, and now I possess her.” Yūten wasted no item. He immediately gave Suke a kaimyō—a posthumous Buddhist name—and wrote it down on the family altar. Suke’s spirit left Kiku’s body and entered the altar. Everyone present dropped to the floor and prayed. Kiku eventually remarried, and lived a happy and prosperous life. The spirits of Kasane and Suke were never heard from again.\n\n",

Aosagibi is the name for a bizarre phenomenon caused by transformed herons—particularly the black-crowned night heron. Found all along the islands and coasts, this heron prefers remote areas with heavy reeds and thick woods. Though aosagibi is most commonly attributed to this particular bird, other herons and wild birds such as ducks and pheasants are able to develop this manifestation. Aosagibi is most commonly seen at night, either in the trees where the herons roost, by the rivers where they hunt, or in the twilight sky as birds fly overhead.\n\nBehavior: Long-lived herons develop shining scales on their breasts, which fuse together from their feathers. With each breath, they blow a yellow iridescent powder from their beaks that scatters into the wind. During the autumn nights, their bodies radiate a bluish-white glow. Their powdery breath ignites into bright blue fireballs, which they blow across the water or high in the trees. These fireballs possess no heat and do not ignite what they touch, but eventually evaporate in the wind.\n\nInteractions: Like most wild birds, night herons are shy and flee from humans. Even after transforming into yōkai, they retain their shyness. While the sight of a colony of wild birds breathing blue flames and making strange calls on a cool autumn night can be rather disconcerting, aosagibi does not post any threat. However, because their fireball breath appears similar to other phenomena, caution should be taken to avoid confusing aosagibi with onibi or other supernatural lights.\n\n",

One day he got into a quarrel over some gossip started by Fujiwara no Yukinari, and in a rage, Sanekata snatched Yukinari’s hat and threw it away. For his bad temper, Sanekata was demoted and exiled far away to a solitary island in Mutsu province in the northeast. There, Sanekata nursed his resentment towards those back in the court at Kyoto, growing ever more resentful of them. Three years into his exile, he died, with thoughts of vengeance poisoning his heart.\n\nWhen the news of Sanekata’s death reached Kyoto, a strange thing began to happen: every morning, when the servants would place food out for the imperial court to eat at the Seiryōden palace, the nyūnai suzume would swoop in and gobble up all of the food in an instant, and then fly off. No matter how much food was laid out, the sparrow would devour every grain of rice, leaving nothing for the palace inhabitants.\n\nIt was not long before the court began to grow very scared of this bird. It began destroy all of the crops in the fields, as well, and nobody knew how to stop the sparrow’s attacks.Rumors began to spread that the sparrow could only be the vengeful ghost, or onryō, of Fujiwara no Sanekata, desperate to return and take revenge upon the imperial court.\n\nAt the same time, the high priest of Kangaku-in, Saint Kanshi, had a sparrow visit him in a dream. The sparrow identified itself as the spirit of Sanekata, desperately longing to return to his beloved Kyoto, and asked the priest to chant and pray for him. The next morning, Kanshi discovered the body of a single sparrow lying dead at the base of a tree on the temple grounds. He recognized the sparrow as the transformed spirit of Fujiwara no Sanekata, and built a small grave for the sparrow, mourning it and praying for its soul.\n\nAfter the sparrow’s grave was built, the attacks stopped. Years later, Kangaku-in’s name changed to Kyōjaku-ji, or Sparrow Temple, and while the Kyoto has changed dramatically since that time, the little grave where the sparrow was buried still remains to this day.\n\nFujiwara no Sanekata’s legacy lives on, too, in the common Japanese name for the russet sparrow: nyūnai suzume.\n\n",

As the name implies, they are soaked with water from head to toe. Often, nure onago are covered with dead leaves and things stuck to their dripping bodies. They wander about dripping and sopping wet, and are encountered on roads near swamps, rivers, and coasts, or during nights of heavy rain.\n\nInteractions: Travelers along the coasts and rivers of the islands of Shikoku and Kyūshū occasionally encounter young girls, lost and soaked to the bone. Most people who witness such a pathetic sight rush over to help the poor girls. When a human draws close to a nure onago, she looks up into their eyes and smiles. If the smile is returned, she will follow the helpful stranger human, sticking by him forever. This isn’t as nice as it seems; nure onago continually drip water and stink of mildew and swamp water. Although she causes no particular harm, her constant presence is often enough to ruin the rest of a person’s life.\n\nIgnoring a nure onago and refusing to return her smile is the only way to avoid this yōkai. Unfortunately, by the time her true nature is discovered it is often too late.\n\nOrigin: Nure onago are born from the strong feelings of loss and sadness shared by widows of drowning victims—particular widows of sailors lost at sea. These feelings build up and materialize into a nure onago, whose desire for attention is the amplified desire of heartbroken widows to see their husbands again.\n\nNure onago behave similarly to hari onago, although in a less violent form. The two are sometimes grouped together as waraionago, smiling girls. Both are also found on the island of Shikoku, suggesting a possible relation between them.

They can range in size from a small dog to the size of a lion and—due to their resemblance to both creatures—are often called lion dogs in English. They have thick, curly manes and tails, powerful, muscular bodies, and sharp teeth and claws. Some koma inu have large horns like a unicorn on their heads. However, many are hornless.\n\nBehavior: Koma inu are fierce and noble beasts. They act like watchdogs, guarding gates and doorways and preventing the wicked from entering. They live together in male-female pairs and are always found together. In their pairs, the female usually guards those living inside, while the male guards the structure itself.\n\nInteractions: Koma inu are a ubiquitous symbol at holy sites in Japan. Stone koma inu statues are almost always found at the entrance to Shinto shrines, often with more inside the shrine guarding the important buildings. The pairs are usually carved in two poses: one with mouth open in a roaring position, and one with mouth closed. Symbolically, these creatures represent yin and yang, or death and life. The open-mouthed koma inu represents the sound “a,” while the closed-mouthed koma inu represents the sound “un.” These sounds are the Japanese transliteration of the Sanskrit “om,” a mystical syllable which symbolizes the beginning, middle, and end of all things. A Western analogy would be alpha and omega.\n\nOrigin: Koma inu were brought to Japan via Korea, which in turn received them from China, which in turn received them from India. China is where they first began to symbolize the Dharmic philosophies of Indian religions. In China these dogs are called shishi, which means “stone lion.” This name is often used in Japan as well, though it only refers to the one with its mouth open. The other one, and the two of them collectively, are always referred to as koma inu.\n\n",

One of these is the kijimunā: an elfin creature that makes it home in the banyan trees that grow all over the Ryukyu archipelago. Physically, kijimunā are about the same height as a child, with wild and thick bright red hair, and red tinted skin. They wear skirts made of grass, and move about by hopping rather than walking. Although kijimunā retain the appearance of child-like youthfulness into their adulthood, males are noted for their large and prominent testicles.\n\nBehavior: The kijimunā lifestyle mimics humans in many ways. They fish along the shores, live in family units, get married, and raise children in much the same way as the native islanders. On rare occasions, they marry into human families. The kijimunā diet consists entirely of seafood. They are excellent fishers, and are particularly skilled at diving. Kijimunā use both these skills to catch their favorite dish: fish heads—specifically the head of the snapper species called the double-lined fusilier. They are especially fond of fish eyes, even preferring the left eye over the right. Okinawans attribute eyeless corpses of fish found on the beach to picky kijimunā.\n\nKijimunā have a number of peculiar fears and prejudices. They loathe chickens and cooking pots. They are extremely put off by people passing gas. However, the thing they hate above all else is the octopus. They avoid octopuses at all costs, despising them and fearing them at the same time.\n\nInteractions: Kijimunā often help fishermen catch fish, or aid humans in other ways in return for a cooked meal. When they form friendships with humans, it can last for a lifetime. Kijimunā will often return to their human friends many times, even spending holidays with their adopted family.\n\nUnprovoked kijimunā attacks on humans are rare. Cutting down the banyan tree in which they live is a sure way to earn their wrath. Kijimunā thus wronged have been known to murder livestock, sabotage boats so they sink while their owners are far out at sea, or magically trap people in hollow trees from which they cannot escape. Sometimes they press down on peoples’ chests while they sleep, or snuff out lights during the night. Once earned, the enmity of a kijimunā can never be assuaged.\n\n",

She appears in The Legend of Anchin and Kiyo hime, or Princess Kiyo, an ancient tale from Wakayama prefecture. Versions of the story appear in a number of ancient books. Her tale is retold in the famous noh play Dōjō-ji.\n\nLegends: Long ago, during the reign of Emperor Daigo, the young priest named Anchin was traveling from Mutsu to Kumano on a pilgrimage. Every year he made the journey, and every year he would lodge at the manor of the Masago no Shōji family. He was an incredibly good looking young man, and he caught the eye of Kiyo hime, the manor lord’s daughter. She was a troublesome young girl. Anchin joked to her that if she were a good girl and behaved herself, he would marry her and take her back to Mutsu.\n\nEvery year Kiyo hime waited for Anchin to come again for his pilgrimage. When she came of age arrived, she reminded him of his promise and asked him to marry her. Anchin, embarrassed that she had taken his word seriously, lied that he would come for her as soon as he finished his pilgrimage. On his return, he avoided the Masago no Shōji manor and headed straight for Mutsu.\n\nWhen Kiyo hime heard of Anchin’s deception, she was overcome with grief. She ran after the young priest, barefoot, determined to marry him. Anchin fled as fast as he could, but Kiyo hime caught him on the road to the temple Dōjō-ji. There, instead of greeting her, Anchin lied again. He pretended not to know her and protested that he was late for a meeting somewhere else. Kiyo hime’s sadness turned into furious rage. She attacked, moving to punish the lying priest. Anchin prayed to Kumano Gongen to save him. A divine light dazzled Kiyo hime’s eyes and paralyzed her body, giving Anchin just enough time to escape.\n\nKiyo hime’s rage exploded to its limits—the divine intervention had pushed her over the edge. She transformed into a giant, fire-breathing serpent. When Anchin reached the Hidaka River, he paid the boatman and begged him not to allow his pursuer to cross. Then, he ran to Dojō-ji for safety. Ignoring the boatman entirely, Kiyo hime swam across the river after Anchin.\n\nSeeing the monstrous serpent, the priests of Dōjō-ji hid Anchin inside of the large, bronze temple bell. However, Kiyo hime could smell Anchin inside. Overcome with rage and despair, she wrapped herself around the bell and breathed fire until the bronze became white hot. She roasted Anchin alive inside the bell. With Anchin dead, the demon Kiyo hime threw herself into the river and drowned.\n\n",

This curse spreads rapidly through town, traveling on the news and gossip about the katawaguruma. Eventually, this brings calamity upon an entire village. Despite this, there is evidence that the katawaguruma has a capacity for mercy alien to its male counterpart.\n\nLegends: In a 17th century record, when a katawaguruma attacked a village in what is now Shiga, she abducted the child of a woman who dared to peek at her through a crack in her door, saying “Instead of watching me you should have been watching your child!” The distraught woman realized her own curiosity was responsible for the loss of her child. She composed a poem expressing her faults, and displayed it all around town, warning others to watch their children more carefully. The next night, the katawaguruma came again and saw that the woman was truly regretful. She returned the child unharmed. The katawaguruma was never seen in that village again.\n\n",

They are powerful and ancient snake-like spirits of the fields, known for their bizarre shape and habits. Short, fat creatures shaped like mallets, Nozuchi are about fifteen centimeters in diameter and just over one meter long. They have no eyes, nose, or any other facial features save for a large mouth located on the tops of their heads, pointing towards the sky. Their bodies are covered in a bristly fur, much like a hairy caterpillar.\n\nBehavior: Nozuchi make their homes inside of large trees, particularly on the tops of hills. They are slow movers, and get about by rolling and tumbling down slopes, then slowly inching their way back up. Their usual diet is wildlife—mice, rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals—however, they are able to eat things much larger than themselves. In Nara, they are known to feed on deer. They can devour a deer in a single bite, pulling the whole animal into their small, stumpy frame.\n\nInteractions: Nozuchi have been known to attack humans who come near their nests, rolling downhill and snapping at their feet. Their bites are dangerous, resulting in terrible, mangled wounds which quickly lead to a high fever and death. A person who is touched or even merely seen by a tumbling nozuchi can contract this fever and die. Fortunately, nozuchi attacks are easily avoided. Stick to higher ground where they cannot tumble, or climb a tree if no other high ground is available.\n\nOTHER FORMS: Nozuchi can transform into a humanoid shape, though they rarely are seen in this form. They take the shape of a human priest, but with no eyes, nose, hair, or ears. The only feature on the head is a large, gaping mouth pointing upwards towards the sky. Wicked monks who are banished from their temples to live in the wilds sometimes gradually turn into nozuchi. These nozuchi are more likely to maintain a humanoid form than a serpentine one. Care should be taken not to confuse a shape-changed nozuchi with a nopperabō, which has a similar appearance but poses a different threat.\n\n",

He is considered one of the greatest poets of the Edo Period. In the 1750’s, while studying painting at Kenshōji in Miyazu, Kyōto, Buson painted a scroll containing eight graffiti-like doodles of bizarre yōkai. His doodles are presented as pictures with names and no stories, so the true origin of these yōkai remains a mystery. They are believed to be based upon local legends that Buson picked during on his travels.\n\nThe illustration of this yōkai in Buson’s painting notes that it comes from the river ferry in what is today Yamashiro village in Kizugawa City, Kyōto. Whatever specific connection this yōkai had with the area is unfortunately lost. The region was historically famous for it’s melons, so it is only natural that it may have had melon yōkai as well.\n\n",

Despite their monstrous appearance, baku are revered as powerful forces of good and as one of the holy protectors of mankind.\n\nBehavior: Baku watch over humans and act as guardian spirits. They feed on the dreams of humans—specifically bad dreams. Evil spirits and yōkai fear baku and flee from baku-inhabited areas. Because of this, health and good luck follow baku wherever they go.\n\nInteractions: The baku’s written name and image have been used as symbols of good luck in talismans and charms throughout Japanese history. In the old days, it was common to embroider the kanji for baku onto pillows in order to keep away bad dreams, sickness, and evil spirits. Fearsome baku images are commonly carved into the pillars above temple doors and on the columns supporting temple roofs. Baku are one of only a handful of holy creatures honored in this manner.\n\nOrigin: Legend has it that when the world was new and the gods were making the animals, the baku was put together from the leftover bits and pieces at the end of creation. That explains its bizarre appearance, and why it is considered a favorite of the gods.\n\nToday, the Japanese word baku also refers to the tapir.

The novel revolves around the life of Hikaru Genji, a noble living in the height of the Heian period. Lady Rokujō’s transformation from noblewoman to demoness has made her one of the most well-known monsters in Japanese theater. Her name comes from Rokujō, the area of Kyoto in which she lived.\n\nLegends: Lady Rokujō was the daughter of a minister living in the capital during the Heian period. She was high ranking, extremely beautiful, elegant, sophisticated, and intelligent. She had been married to the crown prince and would have become empress upon his ascension. However, when her husband passed away Lady Rokujō lost much of her power and standing among the court, robbing her of her ambitions. She sent their daughter away to Ise to become a shrine princess, and became a courtesan of the imperial court.\n\nThe widowed Lady Rokujō soon became one of the mistresses of an aspiring nobleman named Hikaru Genji. She fell deeply in love with him. But because of her age, rank, beauty, and refinement, Genji was reluctant to return her affections. Lady Rokujō also could not express her true feelings as she wished without breaking court decorum. Instead, she repressed her feelings of jealousy, which began to transform her into a demon.\n\nOne night, while sightseeing during the Hollyhock Festival, Lady Rokujō’s carriage collided with the carriage belonging to Genji’s rightful wife Lady Aoi. After already losing her place to Genji’s wife, Lady Rokujō discovered that Lady Aoi was pregnant with Genji’s child. The insult was too much. Her repressed jealousy escaped from her body and transformed into an ikiryō, which haunted Lady Aoi every night. Eventually, the ikiryō was witnessed by Genji, who purchased herbal charms for his wife to protect her against evil spirits.\n\nLady Aoi gave birth to Genji’s son, but shortly afterwards became possessed by Lady Rokujō’s vengeful spirit. (This possession is the subject of the noh play Aoi no Ue.) The ikiryō was finally exorcised by a shugenja, but the possession took its tool of Lady Aoi and she passed away.\n\nLady Rokujō had hoped to become Genji’s next wife, but she discovered that her own hair and clothes carried the odor of Genji’s herbal charms. She realized that she had been responsible for the hauntings. Thinking that Genji could never love her after murdering his wife, Lady Rokujō left the capital and joined her daughter at the Ise Shrine.\n\nSix years later, Lady Rokujō returned to Kyoto with her daughter and became a nun. Shortly afterwards, she fell very ill. Genji came to visit her, and was stricken with her daughter. Lady Rokujō, still deeply in love with Genji, begged him not to take her daughter as a lover. Lady Rokujō passed away, and Genji adopted her daughter as his ward. They moved into her old villa at Rokujō.\n\nEven in death, Lady Rokujō’s jealousy remained as a vengeful shiryō, which appeared at the Rokujō villa. It haunted Genji, attacking his new wife Lady Murasaki and the other ladies of the house. Upon hearing of the hauntings, Lady Rokujō’s daughter became sad that her mother had still not found peace in death. She performed the necessary memorial services to finally put her ghost at ease.\n\n",

But they do not always peacefully pass on to the next life. Some still have unfinished business or karma left to burn off, while others die such violent or passionate deaths that the soul becomes disjointed at the moment of death. They remain in the human world as a demon ghost. Reiki, written by combining the characters for spirit and demon, are the ghosts of oni unable to pass on to the afterlife. Reiki appear just as they did before death, but accompanied by an aura or an eerie glow. They are semi-transparent like ghosts, and often gain supernatural powers in addition to the magic they possessed in life.\n\nBehavior: Reiki have only one motivation: revenge. They bring suffering to the person or people they feel are responsible for their death, or to those who stood against them in life. Reiki will either follow a target or attach themselves to a particular area—often their own grave site—and assault any who come near. They can haunt for centuries. Reiki persist until exorcised by a powerful Buddhist priest.\n\nLegends: There are fewer stories about reiki than about oni, but tales tell of powerful spirits even more fearsome than their living counterparts. One of the most well-known reiki legends takes place at Gangō-ji, a temple in Nara Prefecture. A mysterious force was haunting the temple’s bell tower and murdering children every night. The force was so powerful that not even the most devout priests could identify it, let alone exorcise it.

They look like ordinary rats, only they are as large as cats or even medium-sized dogs.\n\nBehavior: In addition to growing larger and stronger than regular rats and mice, kyūso begin to exhibit peculiar behaviors. Aware of their own size and strength, they no longer scurry away at the first sign of danger. Instead of being chased by cats, they sometimes hunt them down and eat them, reversing their historical relationship.\n\nDespite their ferocity, kyūso are not entirely monstrous. There are a number of folktales and even modern urban legends about kyūso playing with cats, or even raising litters of abandoned kittens as if they were their own children.\n\nInteractions: Even more disturbing than their strange relationship with cats, kyūso are said to occasionally sneak into homes at night and have sexual relations with young women.\n\nOrigin: Kyūso is famously depicted in the Ehon hyakumonogatari and a number of other Edo Period sources, however stories about giant yōkai rats have been a part of Japanese and Chinese folklore since ancient times. Its name is likely a pun. There is an old saying: “kyūso neko wo kamu” (“a cornered rat will bite a cat”). Kyūso (“cornered rat”) and kyūso (“old rat”) are homophones, and it’s possible that this yōkai was invented based on this wordplay.\n\nLegends: A tale from 15th century Dewa Province is recorded in Ehon hyakumonogatari. It tells of a kyūso which had taken up residence in a family’s barn. The family also kept a female cat. She and the kyūso came to be very good friends. One day, the cat became pregnant. She bore a litter of five kittens, but tragically died shortly after giving birth. In her place, the kyūso visited the kittens every night and took care of them. When they had all grown into adult cats, the kyūso vanished from the barn, never to return.\n\nIn Nagoya in the 1750’s, a family was perplexed as to why their lamps were extinguishing themselves every night. Finally they discovered the cause: every night a gigantic rat would appear and lick up all of the oil from each of the house’s lanterns. In order to stop the rat, the family bought a cat. They waited until nightfall and released the cat near where they saw the kyūso. Sure enough, it appeared. The cat leaped upon the kyūso, but the rat was stronger. It tore open the cat’s throat and escaped.\n\nThe family was shocked. They searched all around town until they found a big cat who was very skilled at catching rats. They purchased the cat, and once again released it into the house. That night, when the kyūso appeared, the two creatures locked eyes and began to snarl at one another. Finally, the kyūso couldn’t hold back any more. It leaped at the cat, and tore its throat open just as it had done so before.\n\nA folktale from Kagawa Prefecture describes one instance where a kyūso finally loses to a cat. The cat was a stray taken in by a priest named Ingen from Ōtaki Temple. A huge rat weighing over 26 kilograms was living in the temple’s main building, and had been terrorizing the priests for years. The cat was too small to kill the kyūso by itself. However, after three years of living there, the cat’s tail split in two and it became a cunning nekomata. Out of thanks for Ingen’s kind treatment, the nekomata enlisted an army of local cats to drive the kyūso out of the temple. After a long and bloody battle, the cats were finally able to kill the kyūso.\n\n",

It is characterized by the sound of a large tree falling down, and the crashing vibrations of it hitting the forest floor. Often it is accompanied by a powerful gust of wind.\n\nInteractions: Tengu daoshi is usually only encountered by people who spend much of their time in the mountains, such as woodcutters and Shugendō practitioners. The sound of trees being chopped and crashing to the ground late at night comes from deep within the mountains. It can continue for some time. Occasionally voices can even be heard shouting “Ikuzo!” (the equivalent of shouting “Timber!” as the tree falls). Woodcutters sometimes feel creatures shaking their sleeping huts during the night. However in the morning, there is no sign of fallen trees or any evidence whatsoever of what could have made the noise.\n\nOrigin: Tengu daoshi occurs all over Japan. It is known by many regional names and attributed to many supernatural forces. As the name suggests, it is often believed to be the work of tengu who make their homes deep in mountain valleys. In addition to tengu, animal yōkai are often blamed for this phenomenon. Tanuki are said to kick rocks at humans with their hind legs or slap trees with their tails, causing these mysterious sounds. Kitsune and mujina are sometimes blamed as well. It is also sometimes said to be the sounds of mountain kami.\n\nOther common names for this phenomenon include furusoma (“old woodcutter”), sora kigaeshi and kara kidaoshi (which refer to trees being knocked down from the sky), and tsue tsuki (“cane strike,” as it sounds like trees being struck by walking sticks). In most of Shikoku, tengu daoshi is known as furusoma, meaning “old woodcutter.” Legend has it that the phenomenon is the work of the ghost of an old woodcutter. He was illegally cutting down trees when he was crushed to death under a falling tree. His ghost now haunts the mountains, causing phantom woodcutting sounds.\n\n",

It is a mysterious yokai which takes the form of a hairy, bestial, old man who wanders the wilds and assaults passersby, particularly crying or misbehaving children. Momonjii appear late at night on the road, when the wind blows strongly, and those who meet them suddenly become very sick.\n\nOrigin: The name momonjii was created by a very complicated combination of Japanese puns and wordplay. It is formed from the words momonga and gagoji. Momonga is the Japanese word for a small flying squirrel, but long ago the momonga and musasabi (the Japanese giant flying squirrel) were thought to be the same animal, so their names were used interchangeably. The yokai nobusuma (from which momonjii are created) very closely resembles a musasabi, and so the interchangeable name momonga was often used to refer to the nobusuma. Gagoji is a regional word that refers to a bogeyman-like monster who assaults children. The word comes from the legend of Gagoze, the demon of Gangō-ji; being a regional variation of the demon’s name. Thus, momonga and gagoji were combined to form momonjii, referring to a scary child-assaulting monster which is related to the nobusuma.\n\nDuring the Edo period, there was a strict prohibition on eating meat from certain animals such as deer and boar. These forbidden animals were collectively referred to as momonjii. To get around this prohibition, shops began selling animal meat as “medicine” instead of food. These “medicine” shops were called momonji-ya, and the meat sold there was believed to ward off disease. The fact that this yokai resembles a wild animal and also brings disease is an ironic reference to momonjii and momonji-ya.\n\nThe “medicine” sold at momonji-ya was given nicknames in order to disguise its true contents. For instance, deer meat was called momiji, or maple leaves, and boar meat was referred to as botan, or peony. This secret imagery persists in things like hanafuda playing cards, where deer and maple leaves, and boar and peonies, are depicted together. When Toriyama Sekien, who was very aware of the imagery in hanafuda cards, first illustrated the momonjii, he drew him hiding in a pile of maple leaves — creating yet another connected between this yokai and the prohibition of animal meat.\n\n",

Its face has no eyes at all; instead, it has eyes on the palms of its hands.\n\nBehavior: Tenome wander through open fields or graveyards at night, hunting for tasty humans. They wait until their prey is very close before attacking. By the time one is able to recognize that they are face-to-face with not a zato but a yokai, it is often too late to escape. Tenome can run very quickly, and while their vision is not particularly strong, they have a powerful sense of smell which helps them follow their victims in the dark.\n\nOrigin: Tenome’s true nature is not known, but they are most likely the ghosts of blind men who were robbed and murdered by thugs. This explanation can be traced to a folk tale, in which a man is attacked at night by a monster with eyes on its palms but none on its face. The man flees to a nearby inn for shelter. He tells the innkeeper what he saw, and the innkeeper replies that a few days ago, a blind man was attacked and robbed out in that field. As the man lay dying in the grass, he cried out with his last breath, “If only I could have had once glace at their faces! If I only had eyes that worked — even if only on the palms of my hands…!” The old blind man’s resent-filled death caused him to be reborn as a yokai — with eyes on the palms of its hands, just as he wished.\n\nLegends: In Shichi-jo, Kyoto, a young man entered the graveyard at night as a test of his courage. From out of the darkness, a blind old man approached the young man. When the elderly figure got close enough to be seen in detail, the young man saw that it had eyeballs on the palms of his hands, and it was coming after him!\n\nThe young man ran as fast as he could to a nearby temple and begged the priest for sanctuary. The priest hid the man inside of a long chest and locked the lid. Shortly afterwards, the monster entered the temple, sniffing loudly as if it was hunting. The young man could hear he sniffing noise getting closer and closer, until it stopped right next to the chest he was hiding in. Then, there was a strange slurping sound, like the sound of a dog sucking on an animal’s bones. A little while later, the eerie sounds vanished, and all was quiet. The priest opened up the chest to let the young man out, but all that was inside of the chest was the loose, empty skin of the young man. His bones had been completely sucked out of his body!\n\n",

They have human-like faces and bestial bodies. They feed on the bodies of the dead — particularly the innards — and sometimes bring disease and other evil things with them wherever they go.\n\nInteractions: Chimi tend to be nasty, or at least mischievous, when it comes to humans.

Once isolated in this way, chimi can attack, often killing their victims.\n\nOrigin: The name chimi is derived from the ancient Chinese history known as The Records of the Grand Historian: Chi is the name of a tiger-like mountain god, while Mi is a swamp god with the head of a boar and the body of a human.

They were once human women who were consumed by jealousy and transformed into demonesses. The name hannya also refers to a specific type of demon mask used in noh theater.\n\nThere are three grades of hannya: namanari, chūnari, and honnari. Namanari hannya are kijo that still resemble human women. They have small horns and use dark magic to perform their evil deeds, such as summoning ikiryō to attack their enemies. They are not completely evil; there remains a chance for these beginner demons to return to humanity. Chūnari hannya are mid-level demons. They have long, sharp horns, tusk-like fangs, and more powerful magic. However, they are still vulnerable to Buddhist prayers. Honnari hannya are true demons and the most powerful of the three. They have serpentine bodies and breathe fire. Honnari hannya have embraced their jealousy so deeply that there is no calming their fury.\n\nOrigin: Hannya originate from the Sanskrit term for wisdom—specifically Prajñāpāramitā, the highest form of Buddhist wisdom which leads to enlightenment. The juxtaposition of the highest form of wisdom and creatures who represent direct opposition to that wisdom comes from the use of the hannya mask in noh. In the play Aoi no Ue, a shugenja (an ascetic mystic) exorcises the spirit of the hannya Lady Rokujō from Lady Aoi. As it is driven away, the evil spirit cries out, “Oh, how horrible! The voice of wisdom is like a demon!” Since then, demon masks and wisdom have been associated with each other.\n\nThe three most famous hannya from Japanese literature are Lady Rokujō from Aoi no Ue, Kurozuka from Kurozuka, and Kiyo-hime from Dōjō-ji.\n\n",

Sometimes the vague shape of a human or bestial face can be seen in the flames.\n\nBehavior: Tsurubebi do very little other than bob up and down or drop from branches. Their flames produce no heat and do not burn the trees that they live in; nor do these yokai pose any other known threat. While tsurubebi is most often considered to be a tree spirit, it has also been suggested that it is closely related to another yokai named tsurube otoshi. These two yokai share many similarities, including their names, coniferous habitat, and dropping-down behavior.

They are found all over Japan, though details about them vary from region to region. They take the form of a small child dressed as a Niō, a monk, or a samurai, and appear in bedrooms late at night.\n\nBehavior: Makuragaeshi gets it is named for its primary activity: flipping pillows. People who sleep in a room haunted by a makuragaeshi often wake up to find that their pillow has been flipped and is now at their feet. Makuragaeshi are also known for other minor pranks, such as running through ashes and leaving dirty footprints around the rooms they haunt.\n\nWhile most stories about makuragaeshi present them as harmless pranksters, there are a few stories that describe scarier powers. Some don’t flip the pillow, but lift up and flip people instead. Others pick up entire tatami mats that people are sleeping on and bounce them around.  Still others are said to sit on their victim’s chest while he or she sleeps, pressing down hard and squeezing the wind out of the lung. They occasionally cause kanashibari, or sleep paralysis. The most extreme stories say that anyone who sees a makuragaeshi loses consciousness, after which the makuragaeshi steals their soul, leaving them dead.\n\nOrigin: There are as many theories as to where makuragaeshi come from as there are variants of zashiki-warashi. Most often they linked to the ghosts of people — particularly children — who died in the room they come to haunt. As makuragaeshi are generally lower in rank than zashiki-warashi, they are often the result of ghosts which died tragically, such as murder victims. However, some makuragaeshi have also been attributed to shape-shifting, prank-loving yokai such as tanuki or saru. Others still have attributed this spirit to the actions of monster cats such as kasha.\n\n",

It is the primary residence of the dragon god of the sea and his daughter Otohime, and is home to the ocean’s royal court. The palace is populated by aquatic creatures who wear human clothing and have a society which mirrors that of the human world.\n\nRyūgū is a complex of many buildings. It is composed largely of coral, pearl, and crystal, while other precious materials such as gems, gold, silver, and fish scales are used in its construction. One of its most famous features is its gardens, which contain all four seasons at the same time. The eastern gardens are in perpetual spring. Cherries, plums, and willows are always in full bloom, swaying in the spring breeze, and the songs of nightingales can be heard from within the cool mist. The southern gardens are in endless summer. Dew-covered hydrangeas and lotus blossoms decorate the gardens, and waterfowl playing in the ponds send cool waves to lap the shores. The trees are thick and lush, and the sky reverberates with the ringing of cicadas and the singing of cuckoos. In the western gardens, autumn reigns. The trees display brilliant yellows and reds, while white chrysanthemums decorate the ground. Deer graze in the dewy grass, and call out into enveloping fog. In the north it is always winter. The treetops are barren, their dead leaves twinkling with frost. The mountains are covered in a blanket of powdery snow, and thin wisps of charcoal smoke rise out from distant chimneys.\n\nThe location of Ryūgū varies from story to story; it can be accessed through caves, at the bottom of rivers or lakes (such as Lake Biwa, Japan’s largest lake), along the coast, or on a floating island in the distant ocean, but most often it is said to lie on the bottom of the sea. The palace can be seen on the ocean’s distant horizon, in mirages made from clams’ breath—or shinkirō.\n\nInteractions: Despite being separated from the human world, there are plenty of stories about humans and inhabitants of Ryūgū visiting each other, such as when a jinja hime appeared off the coast of Hizen Province in 1819 to foretell a bumper crop followed by a cholera epidemic. Fabulous treasures from the dragon palace are sometimes given to human visitors—such as kanju and manju, the pearls which control the ebb and flow of the tides, and the tamatebako of Urashima Tarō’s legend.\n\nTime passes at a different rate in Ryūgū compared to the outside world. Although the rate differs from story to story, one day spent at Ryūgū is usually equivalent to several years or more on the surface. Humans who visit Ryūgū for an extended period return to the surface world to discover that it has changed dramatically since they left.\n\nOrigin: In early Japanese mythology this palace was called Watatsumi no miya, named for Watatsumi—the god of the sea. Like other Japanese deities, Watatsumi was depicted with a human-like form. During the middle ages, as aspects of Chinese mythology and Buddhism were absorbed into Japanese mythology, the idea that the ocean was ruled by ryūō—dragon kings—became popular. The name Ryūgū and the depiction of the god of the sea as a dragon have since became the popular standard.\n\nLegends: The most famous account of Ryūgū comes from the legend of Urashima Tarō, the young man who rescued a turtle and was brought to the palace as a reward. He spends some time there and even falls in love with the beautiful princess Otohime, but his story ends tragically when he returns to the surface world only to find that centuries have elapsed and everyone he ever knew is dead.\n\n",

Japanese weasels, known as itachi, are disconcerting animals. They bring ill omens, and people fear their particular brand of magic. Like most animals-turned-yōkai, they possess shape-shifting abilities in addition to a number of supernatural powers.\n\nInteractions: Itachi are tricksters and pranksters, but generally shy away from interaction with humans. As a result, they are mistrusted and disliked. Itachi calls are also considered to be ill omens. After the yelping cries of a group of itachi are heard, misfortune and despair always follows. Though itachi can transform, they prefer to use other kinds of magic—usually with unfortunate results for their targets. When an itachi is seen standing on its hind legs it is said to be bewitching a human—perhaps hypnotizing them into leaving out food or performing some other task for the weasel’s benefit. Itachi are dangerous in groups. They gather together at night, climb up onto each other’s shoulders, and create huge columns of fire which erupt into whirlwinds. These are frequently blamed for starting conflagrations which can burn down entire towns.\n\nOrigin: In the old days, weasels were believed to transform into ten (martens) or mujina (badgers or tanuki, depending on the region) after reaching an old age. Additionally, the names ten and itachi were often used interchangeably. As a result, there is confusion over which animal is being referred to in many stories.\n\nOther forms: Itachi are often considered to be the most skilled shape-changing animals, possessing more forms than any other shape-changer. An old phrase about animal yōkai goes, “Kitsune nanabake, tanuki hachibake, ten kubake”—foxes seven forms, tanuki eight forms, martens (i.e. itachi) nine forms. When an itachi changes its shape, it usually adopts the form of a young priest boy dressed in clothes that are too big for him. This form is used chiefly to acquire alcohol, which the weasels cannot brew. Itachi also frequently adopt the forms of other yōkai in order to scare humans. One of their favorites is the ōnyūdō: a colossal, bald-headed giant who terrorizes villages, destroys houses, devours livestock and even eats people.\n\n",

They live in the undersea palace of Ryūgū, and like their father, their true form is that of an enormous dragon called a wani. However, they are usually depicted in art in human form, wearing the garb of ancient Japanese princesses.\n\nOrigin: Toyotama hime and Tamayori hime appear in both Kojiki and Nihon shoki, Japan’s oldest written mythologies. They are important figures in Shintō, being the grandmother and the mother of the Japanese imperial line.\n\nToyotama hime’s name literally means “luxuriant pearl princess,” but it also implies a priestess who is filled with an abundance of divine spirits. Tamayori hime’s name also refers to holy women who are possessed by powerful divine spirits—illustrating these sisters’ importance in Shintō mythology.\n\nDue to the many similarities between the story of Toyotama hime and Otohime from the Urashima Tarō legend, Otohime is often thought to be modeled after Toyotama hime.\n\nLegends: One day a hunter named Hoori from the surface world visited Ryūgū. He came to ask the sea god for permission to search the grounds of Ryūgū for the fish hook that he had borrowed from his older brother Hoderi and then lost. By a well in the gardens of Ryūgū, Hoori encountered Toyotama hime. They found each other to be very beautiful, and were soon married.\n\nHoori lived with Toyotama hime in Ryūgū for three years, but then remembered his quest to find the missing hook and he grew depressed. Tamayori hime told her father the sea god, who asked Hoori what was wrong. Hoori explained his problem. The sea god summoned all of the fish in the ocean and asked if any of them had seen the hook. A tai complained of a pain in its throat that was preventing it from eating. Upon inspection, a hook was discovered lodged in its throat. It was the hook that Hoori was searching for. The sea god returned the hook to Hoori. He also promised Hoori that he would send rain upon his fields and make him rich, while denying rain to his older brother’s fields. He lent the tide-controlling jewels manju and kanju to Hoori to defend himself against Hoderi’s attacks. Then he set Hoori on the back of an enormous dragon for his return trip to the surface world.\n\nSure enough, the sea god’s interventions caused Hoderi’s harvests to grow poor and poorer while Hoori’s grew richer and richer, spurring Hoderi to attack Hoori. Using the power of the tide-controlling jewels, Hoori raised the tide and drowned his older brother, forcing him into submission. Only when Hoderi promised to serve Hoori for the rest of time did Hoori lower the tide again.\n\nDuring this time Toyotama hime became pregnant with Hoori’s child. When her delivery grew near, she and her sister Tamayori hime came to the surface world on the back of a giant turtle to give birth. She asked Hoori to build her a birthing hut thatched with cormorant feathers along the shore, but she went into labor before he was able to complete it. Toyotama hime entered the hut. She informed Hoori that to give birth she must return to her natural form, and she asked him not to look upon her while giving birth. But Hoori could not resist. He peeked in on her and saw his wife in the form of an enormous wani, eight leagues long, creeping and writhing about on her belly.\n\nToyotama hime was ashamed at having her true form revealed. Although she desired to remain on the land, she returned to Ryūgū, leaving her newborn child behind. When she left, she closed the path that linked the land and sea kingdoms, forever separating them. Toyotama hime felt angry and betrayed, but she still loved Hoori. So she asked Tamayori hime to care for the child in her place. Tamayori hime nursed and raised her nephew, who came to be known as Ugayafukiaezu. When he grew up, he married Tamayori hime. They had four children together, one of whom became the legendary Emperor Jimmu, first emperor of Japan.\n\n",

They come out from the floors, ceilings, and the woodwork late at night when everyone is in bed, and they run about the house performing mischief.

Late at night, when they were all fast asleep, the entire house suddenly began to shake violently. The ronin, thinking it was an earthquake, dashed outside for safety, however they soon realized that it was only the house that was shaking…\n\nThe next day the group of ronin visited a wise man who lived nearby and told him of their experience at the haunted house. The wise man offered to stay with them that night to see for himself. Sure enough, late at night, the entire house began to shake violently just as before. The wise man looked carefully at the floor. Locating the area where the most violent shaking was originating, he stabbed his dagger deep into the tatami mat. Suddenly, the shaking stopped entirely.\n\nThe next morning, the ronin and the wise man examined the house. Under the floor where the wise man had stabbed his dagger, they found a strange gravestone dedicated to the memory of a bear. Where the knife had penetrated the stone tablet, blood was trickling out.\n\nThe wise man asked others in the neighborhood what the strange gravestone could mean, and they explain that some time ago, there was a bear in these parts who frequently broke into peoples’ houses at night. One night it broke into that particular house, and the man who lived in there killed it. In order to appease the spirit of the bear he killed and protect himself from the vengeful ghost of the bear, he had a gravestone placed in the house dedicated to the bear’s memory. The ghost of the bear must have possessed that gravestone, which is what had been causing the yanari to appear every night and shake the house for years.\n\n",

For that reason, Tamamo no Mae is considered one of the Nihon San Dai Aku Yōkai—the Three Terrible Yōkai of Japan.\n\nOrigin: Tamamo no Mae appears in numerous texts and has been a popular subject throughout Japanese history. Her story is portrayed in literature, noh, kabuki, bunraku, and other forms of art. There are several variations on her story.\n\nLegends: Tamamo no Mae was born some 3,500 years ago in what is now China. Her early life is a mystery, but she eventually became a powerful sorceress. After hundreds of more years she became a white faced, golden furred kyūbi no kitsune—a nine-tailed fox with supreme magical power. In addition, she was an expert at manipulation. She used her charms and wit to advance her standing and influence world affairs.\n\nDuring the Shang Dynasty Tamamo no Mae was known as Daji. She disguised herself as a beautiful woman and became the favorite concubine of King Zhou of Shang. Daji was a model of human depravity. She held orgies in the palace gardens. Her fondness for watching and inventing new forms of torture are legendary. Daji eventually brought about the fall of the entire Shang Dynasty. She managed to escape execution, and fled to the Magadha kingdom in India in 1046 BCE.\n\nIn Magadha, she was known as Lady Kayō, and became a consort of King Kalmashapada, known in Japan as Hanzoku. She used her beauty and charms to dominate the king, causing him to devour children, murder priests, and commit other unspeakable horrors. Eventually—whether because she ran out children to eat or because Kalmashapada began to turn away from her and towards Buddhism—she fled back to China.\n\nDuring the Zhou Dynasty she called herself Bao Si, and was known as one of the most desirable women in all of China. In 779 BCE she became a concubine of King You. Not satisfied as just a mistress, she manipulated the king into deposing his wife Queen Shen and making Bao Si his new queen. Though she was beautiful, Bao Si rarely ever smiled. In order to please his beautiful new wife, King You committed acts of such evil and atrocity that eventually all of his nobles abandoned and betrayed him. Eventually, King You was killed and Bao Si captured and the Western Zhou Dynasty was brought to an end in 771 BCE. Somehow Bao Si managed to escape again; she went into hiding for many years.\n\nLittle is known of her activities until the 700s, when she resurfaced disguised as a 16-year old girl named Wakamo. She tricked the leaders of the 10th Japanese envoy to the Tang Dynasty—Kibi no Makibi, Abe no Nakamaro, and Ganjin—as they were preparing to return home to Japan. Wakamo joined their crew and took the ship to Japan, where she hid herself away for over 300 years.\n\nIn the 1090s, she resurfaced once again. This time she transformed herself into a human baby and hid by the side of the road. A married couple found the baby and rescued it, taking her in as their daughter and naming her Mikuzume. She proved to be an exceedingly intelligent and talented young girl, and was so beautiful that she attracted to attention of everyone around her. When she was 7 years old, Mikuzume recited poetry before the emperor. His imperial majesty immediately took a liking to her and employed her as a servant in his court.\n\nMikuzume excelled at court, absorbing knowledge like a sponge. There was no question she could not answer, whether it was about music, history, astronomy, religion, or Chinese classics. Her clothes were always clean and unwrinkled. She always smelled pleasant. Mikuzume had the most beautiful face in all of Japan, and everyone who saw her loved her.\n\nDuring the summer of her 18th year, a poetry and instrument recital was held in Mikuzume’s honor. During the recital, an unexpected storm fell upon the palace. All of the candles in the recital room were snuffed, leaving the participants in the dark. Suddenly, a bright light emanated from Mikuzume’s body, illuminating the room. Everybody at court was so impressed by her genius and declared that she must have had an exceedingly good and holy previous life. She was given the name Tamamo no Mae. Emperor Toba, already exceedingly fond of her, made her his consort.\n\nAlmost immediately after she became the emperor’s consort, the emperor fell deathly ill. None of the court physicians could determine the cause, and so the onmyōji Abe no Yasunari was called in. Abe no Yasunari read the emperor’s fortune and divined that he was marked by a bad omen. After that, the highest priests and monks were summoned to the palace to pray for the emperor’s health.\n\nThe best prayers of the highest priests had no effect, however. The emperor continued to grow worse. Abe no Yasunari was summoned again to read the emperor’s fortune. This time, to his horror the onmyōji discovered that the emperor’s beloved Tamamo no Mae was the cause of his illness. She was a kitsune in disguise, and was shortening the emperor’s life span in order to take over as ruler of Japan. Emperor Toba was reluctant to believe the diviner’s words, but agreed to test Tamamo no Mae just to be sure.\n\nTo save the emperor’s life, Abe no Yasunari prepared the Taizan Fukun no Sai, the most secret and most powerful spell known to onmyōdō. Tamamo no Mae was ordered to perform part of the ritual. They reasoned that an evil spirit would not be able to participate in such a holy ritual. Though she was reluctant to participate, the emperor’s ministers persuaded her. They told her that it would increase her standing an admiration among the court. She had little choice but to accept.\n\nWhen the ritual was performed, Tamamo no Mae dressed even more beautifully than normal. She recited the holy worlds as expected and played her part extremely well. But just as she prepared to wave the ceremonial staff, she vanished. Abe no Yasunari’s divination was confirmed. The court flew into an uproar.\n\nSoon after, word arrived that women and children were disappearing near Nasuno in Shimotsuke Province. The court sorcerers determined that Tamamo no Mae was the cause, and it was decided that she must be destroyed once and for all. The emperor summoned the best warriors in all of the land and then charged the most superb of them, Kazusanosuke and Miuranosuke, to find Tamamo no Mae. The warriors gladly accepted the honor. They purified themselves and set out with an army of 80,000 men to slay the nine-tailed kitsune.\n\nUpon reaching Nasuno the army quickly found the kitsune. The warriors chased her for days and days, but the fox used her magical powers and outsmarted them time and time again, easily escaping. The army grew weary, and frustration set in. It seemed that nothing they did was working. However, Kazusanosuke and Miuranosuke would not accept the shame of defeat and vowed to press on. They practiced harder, honing their tactics, and eventually picked up the kitsune’s trail.\n\nOne night, Miuranosuke had a prophetic dream. A beautiful young girl appeared before him, crying. She begged: “Tomorrow I will lose my life to you. Please save me.” Miuranosuke adamantly refused, and upon waking the warriors set out again to find Tamamo no Mae. Sure enough, the next day they caught her. Miuranosuke fired two arrows, one through the fox’s flank and one through its neck. Kazusanosuke swung his blade. It was over, just as the dream had said.\n\nHowever, Tamamo no Mae’s evil did not end with her death. One year after she died, Emperor Konoe died, heirless. The following year, her lover and former Emperor Toba died as well. A succession crisis ignited between forces loyal to Emperor Go-Shirakawa and forces loyal to former Emperor Sutoku. This crisis started the Fujiwara-Minamoto rivalry that led to the Genpei War, the end of the Heian period, and the rise of the first shoguns. As if that were not enough, Tamamo no Mae’s spirit haunted a massive boulder which killed every living thing that touched it.\n\n",

The are roughly man-sized, and appear similar to larger versions of the native monkeys found in the region.\n\nInteractions: Satori appear to travelers on mountain roads, or folks living in mountain huts far from civilization. If the opportunity presents itself, they gladly dine on anyone they can get their hands on. In cases where they encounter a lone human female, they often take her away into the mountains and rape her. Satori are most well known for their uncanny ability to read people’s minds and then speak their thoughts faster than the individuals can get the words out themselves. This makes it very difficult to hunt, trick, or escape from a hungry satori. However, should something unforeseen happen, such as being unexpectedly hit by an object, satori grow very frightened and run away. One of the only ways to avoid being eaten by one of these yokai is to completely empty one’s mind; with no mind to read, the satori grows bored and wanders away.\n\nOrigin: The name satori literally means “enlightenment” in the Buddhist sense. The satori, with its uncanny ability to read thoughts, comes across as a kind of enlightened being to scared travelers, which is how it got its name. This also relates to the method of escaping a satori — true enlightenment comes from emptying one’s mind of distracting, worldly thoughts, just as salvation from the hungry satori comes from an empty, zen-like mindset.\n\nThe origin of the satori is not entirely clear. Edo-period encyclopedias relate satori with yamako, apes from western China and captures women to rape or to eat. It has also been theorized that satori are cousins of yamabiko, a small monkey-like yokai. The satori’s ability to read people’s minds and the yamabiko’s ability to mimic their words are rooted in the same folklore. More recent folklorists have suggested that satori are fallen mountain gods of the ancient proto-Shinto religion which have been corrupted into yokai over the ages.\n\n",

Their distant laughter is often heard late at night by woodcutters and travelers who find themselves in the mountains past dark.\n\nInteractions: Despite their non-threatening appearance, warai onna are quite dangerous. Those who travel into mountains where warai onna live risk their lives. Upon meeting a warai onna, she will smile and laugh at a person. Their laughter is infectious, and often causes those who meet them to laugh along too. However, even after the warai onna leaves, the people who laughed along with her will continue, rolling on the ground laughing until they are out of breath and unable to stand. These fits of laughter progress into a terrible fever which, after a few days, kills its victims.\n\nEven those who resist laughing along with a warai onna are not safe. Merely hearing their laughter is enough to induce psychosis. A warai onna’s laughter can drive those who hear it to madness. They begin to hear mocking laughter wherever they go—even from rocks, trees, water, and wind. Those who survive such an encounter are doomed to hear this yōkai’s mocking laughter wherever they go, for the rest of their lives.\n\nOrigin: Warai onna come from the folklore of Kōchi Prefecture. They are said to appear in the mountains on fixed days: the first, ninth, and seventeenth days of every month. Because of this, locals warn others to stay out of the mountains on those days.\n\nLegends also tell of warai otoko—male versions of the same yōkai. They behave exactly the same way as warai onna. A related yōkai invented by Toriyama Sekien and called kerakera onna (“cackling woman”) has almost the exact same features as warai onna, except that she appears in red light districts instead of mountains.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a samurai named Higuchi Kandayū ignored the villagers’ warnings and went hunting with his retainers on Mount Tōkō on the ninth day of the month. On the trail, a beautiful woman around seventeen or eighteen years old appeared before him. She pointed a finger and laughed at him. As she laughed, her voice grew higher, and louder, and fiercer. Soon it seemed to Kandayū that the entire mountain was laughing at him. The trees, the rocks, the rivers, and even the wind seemed to echo her laughter. Kandayū and his retainers fled in terror, and when they finally exited the mountains, his retainers all fainted. Although he escaped successfully, Kandayū was haunted by that laughter, which echoed in his ears until he died.\n\n",

As goddesses, hashihime may take different forms depending on occasion, however they are commonly depicted wearing white robes, white face-paint, an iron trivet, and carrying five candles. This is a ceremonial outfit used to perform curses.\n\nInteractions: Hashihime ferociously guard the bridges they inhabit. As with most gods connected to a location, they are very competitive and jealous.  If one praises or speaks positively about another bridge while on top of a hashihime’s bridge, or if one recites lines from certain Noh plays that feature a woman’s wrath as the main theme, something terrible is likely to happen to that person.\n\nDespite their fearsome nature, they are highly honored by the people who live nearby, and shrines are established in their honor near the bridges they inhabit. In times of war, residents will beseech their local hashihime to guard the bridge against invaders. In times of peace, hashihime are goddess of separation and severing, and are asked to aid people in things such as break-ups, divorce, and severing bad luck. So strong is their power of severing that it is considered taboo for lovers to pass in front of a hashihime shrine together, or for wedding processions to pass in front of one. If newlyweds need to cross a bridge inhabited by a hashihime, they will instead pass underneath it on a boat rather than risk cursing their marriage.\n\nLegends: The most famous hashihime story comes from Tsurugi no Maki, in The Tale of the Heike, and is retold in the noh play Kanawa.\n\nA woman visited the the Kifune-jinja in Kyoto at the hour of the ox (roughly 2 am), filled with rage and jealousy towards her ex-husband who had thrown her away for another woman. Night after night she visited the shrine, praying to the gods enshrined there to turn her into a powerful demon. The woman wanted nothing else other than to see her ex-husband destroyed, even at the cost of her own life. After seven nights of pilgrimage, her prayers were answered: the gods told her that if she immersed herself in the Uji river for twenty-one nights, she would become a living demon.\n\nThe woman did as she was bid. She donned a white robe and tied her hair up into five horns. She painted her face and covered her body in crimson dye. She placed an upturned trivet on her head and attached torches to each foot. She lit a torch on both ends and placed it in her mouth. She immersed herself in the Uji river and for twenty-one days she kindled the hatred in her heart. Then, just as the gods told her, after twenty-one days she transformed into a terrible kijo with supreme power. She had become the hashihime of Uji.\n\nThat night, her husband awoke from a horrible dream with a premonition of danger. He quickly sought out the famous onmyōji, Abe-no-Seimei. Seimei recognized the dream as a sign that the man’s former wife would come and destroy the couple that very night, and promised to save them. He went to their house, recited magical prayers, and crafted two katashiro — magical paper doll representations of the man and his wife, meant to be used as substitutionary targets for the kijo’s rage. That night, as Seimei had predicted, the demon appeared. She attacked the two katashiro instead of the real couple, and Seimei’s magic worked: her power was reflected back upon her and she was driven away. The demon woman, realizing that she could not overcome Abe-no-Seimei’s magic, vanished, threatening that she would come back  another time.\n\n",

She is usually depicted in the traditional dress of ama, bare-breasted and carrying a knife used to pry crustaceans from the rocks.\n\nOrigin: Tamatori hime’s legend is preserved by temples associated with her, such as Shidoji in Kagawa Prefecture and Hōgon-ji in Lake Biwa. It is also told in the the famous noh play Ama.\n\nLegends: In 669 CE Fujiwara no Kamatari, founder of the Fujiwara clan, died. When his daughter Byakkō, living in China as a consort to Emperor Gaozong of Tang, received news of her father’s death in 669 CE, she was overcome with grief. She sent a ship full of treasures from China to her brother Fujiwara no Fuhito as an offering for their father’s memorial service. Among these were three of China’s most unique treasures: a bronze bell called Kagenkei, a carved stone called Shihinseki, and a flawless jewel called Menkōfuhai no Tama.\n\nAs the ship passed near the shore of Shidō in Sanuki Province, the sky grew dark and the sea grew furious. As the waters washed over the deck, a great dragon was spotted swimming between the waves—it was Ryūjin. He snatched Menkōfuhai no Tama from the ship and then sunk down to the sea floor, taking the priceless jewel with him.\n\nWhen Fujiwara no Fuhito heard of the theft of Menkōfuhai no Tama, he went to Shido to search for it, disguising himself as a commoner named Tankai. While investigating the whereabouts of the jewel, he fell in love with an ama named Tamamo, the daughter of a fisherman. Together they had a son, whom they named Fusasaki, and for several years they lived happily as a family.\n\nOne day, Fujiwara no Fuhito decided to reveal his noble identity and his reason for coming to Shido to his wife. As an ama, Tamamo was able to dive down to the bottom of the sea—perhaps even all the way to Ryūgū. And so, out of her love for Fuhito, she resolved to recover the lost jewel for him or to die trying.\n\nTamamo dove into the sea, carrying only an ama’s knife and one end of the lifeline held by her husband on the shore. She swum deeper than she ever had gone before. She slipped into Ryūgū and found Menkōfuhai no Tama. Ryūjin himself was guarding it. Tamamo quickly snatched the jewel. Then she swam towards the surface harder than she ever had before. Her life depended on it.\n\nRyūjin was furious. He sent a swarm of sea creatures after Tamamo. Armed with only a small knife, she fought as hard as she could; but her breath was failing and she was no match for the forces of the dragon king. Tamamo knew she would not make it to the surface. With her knife, she cut deep into the flesh under her breast and pressed the jewel into her body. Then she tugged on the lifeline, signalling for Fuhito to real her in.\n\nFuhito pulled the rope as quickly as he could, but it was too late. He pulled Tamamo’s battered body out of the sea and cradled her. With her last breaths, she told him where she hid the jewel, and she begged him to look after their son. Then she died in his arms.\n\nFuhito was overcome with grief. He swore to honor her sacrifice by raising their son to be a great man. He laid Tamamo’s body to rest in Shido-ji, and then he took Fusasaki to the capital and educated him as a noble. Fusasaki became Fujiwara no Fusasaki, a great minister and the head of the most powerful branch of the Fujiwara clan. When Fusasaki learned of his mother’s great sacrifice, he made a pilgrimage to her grave in Shido. He built one thousand stone pagodas in her honor, and expanded the small temple into a great one.\n\nThe graves of the ama still stand at Shido-ji in Kagawa. Menkōfuhai no Tama is now kept in the treasure house of Hōgon-ji on Chikubu Island in Lake Biwa.\n\n",

In actuality, they have two eyes, but one of them is so huge and the other so tiny that they appear to have only one eye. Their bodies are covered in fine gray hair, and they can be found wearing old clothes, tattered rags, or nothing at all. Their teeth are sharp and very powerful — a yamajijii’s bite is said to be strong enough to crush the bones of wild boars or monkeys.\n\nBehavior: Yamajijii live in the mountains far from human settlements. They rarely appear before humans, but their tracks are easily recognizable. They leave deep, sunken footprints about 12 inches long every 6 to 7 feet (from their hopping about on one leg). Because their bite is so strong, hunters would sometimes tame yamajijii and use them to drive away wolves. They also have the uncanny ability to read peoples’ thoughts as they think of them. They are most well known, however, for their powerful voices. The cry of a yamajijii is so powerful it blows the leaves off of branches, splits trees and moves rocks, reverberates through the mountains, and shakes the heavens and the earth. They enjoy shouting contests, and will occasionally allow a human to challenge them; however, humans who are close to a yamajijii when it shouts sometimes have their eardrums burst, or even die.\n\nLegends: A legend from Shikoku tells of a brave hunter who challenged a yamajijii to a shouting contest. On the hunter’s turn, he fired his rifle when he shouted, winning the contest. Later, the yamajijii realized he had been tricked, shape-shifted into a spider, and sneaked into the hunter’s bed to attack him in his sleep. In some versions of the tale, the clever hunter prepares for the shouting contest by praying to the gods of Ise and crafting a special holy bullet inscribed with their names. This bullet had a very special power: when fired it would never miss its target. Because of its magic, whenever the hunter carried it with him it would invariably attract the attention of yokai; however, any time a yamajijii came near enough to threaten him, the hunter would display the bullet, and the yamajijii would flee in terror.\n\nA tale from Tokushima tells of a group of woodcutters warming themselves by a fire in a cabin when yamajijii suddenly appeared to them. The woodcutters were terrified and all thought of the same idea: kill the yokai! The yamajijii read each one of their minds one by one and learned of their thoughts, when suddenly one of the logs in the fire split with a loud snap! The yamajijii thought that there must be a mind he could not read among the hunters, and he quickly fled the cabin in terror.\n\nA story from Kochi tells of a kind yamajijii who gave a sorghum seed to a poor farmer as a gift. The farmer sowed the seed and that year was blessed with an incredible harvest. That winter, the yamajijii returned and asked for some mochi to eat. The grateful farmer gladly gave the yamajijii as much mochi as it could eat. The next year another great harvest followed, and again the yamajijii came back in the winter to ask for mochi. Each year, the yamajijii was able to eat more and more mochi, until it was able to eat 3 huge barrels-full. The farmer became afraid of losing his fortune, and gave the yamajijii a pile of burned stones, passing them off as yaki-mochi. The yamajijii ate them, but soon began to feel sick and hot. The farmer offered a cup of hot oil, passing it off as tea, but the yamajijii realized the farmer’s trick. Surprised and hurt, it fled into the woods, but died before it could get back to its home. Afterwards, the farmer’s family fell into ruin and was never rich again.\n\n",

In this case, it is an animated shōgo (鉦吾) — a small, bowl-shaped gong that is struck with a mallet and used in Buddhist services. A shōgo gets a lot of use, being used multiple times every service. It is made of metal, and so can last a long time before breaking. A gong which has long worn out and stopped playing its note pleasantly, and gets put into storage until it is forgotten (or perhaps one is the witness to some horrible crime) is an ideal candidate for awakening into a yokai.\n\nBehavior: Like nay tsukumogami, shōgorō are not dangerous. At most, they are startling, as they wander around at night like some kind of metal turtle, striking their bodies and ringing their notes out into the night. It is enough perhaps to cause loss of sleep, but not much else.\n\nOrigin: The name shogorō is a pun. It is a combination of shōgo, the gong, and gorō, a very common part of a boy’s name. The word can also be read as a combination of shōgo and goryō (御霊), the ghost of a noble or an aristocrat from ages past. Goryō are a grade of ghost above yūrei, and play a large part in many Japanese ghost stories.\n\nLegends: In the early 18th century, there was a wealthy merchant family called Yodoya living in Osaka. For many generations, the Yodoya were the kings of the rice trade, raking in unbelievable amounts of cash. The 5th generation boss, Yodoya Tatsugorō, had so much money and lived a life of such extreme opulence that he attracted the attention of the bakufu (regional shogunate officials, something like military police).\n\nThe bakufu decided that the Yodoya family had accumulated too much wealth. They were only a merchant family, and it was improper for a lower class to hold so much wealth. Their economic power was above their station in life, and so the bakufu stripped Yodoya Tatsugorō of everything he had: his rice, his business, his house, his every last possession. The Yodoya family fell into ruin, and Tatsugorō became destitute. Even his favorite possession, an unbelievably rich and indescribably splendid golden chicken called kogane no niwatori (金の鶏, literally “golden chicken”), was taken from him. The loss of his precious golden chicken caused Tatsugorō so much grief that he died, and because of the unhappy circumstances of his death, his ghost was unable to pass on.\n\nNormally, when a ghost lingers like this, it attaches itself to the object of its desire, be it a person, a place, or (in this case) a thing. Tatsugorō’s soul meant to attach itself to his precious kogane no niwatori. In Japanese, the words for “gong” and “golden” can both be read “kane.” Poor Tatsugorō’s ghost must have gotten confused and attached itself to a nearby shōgo instead of his chicken, and the instrument turn into a tsukumogami.\n\n",

In particular, while chimi refers to mountain and swamp spirits, mōryō refers to water spirits. They are said to look like children about three years old, with red or black skin, red eyes, long ears, and long, beautiful hair.\n\nInteractions: Mōryō feed upon the bodies of dead humans. As such, they like to rob graves, digging corpses up out of the ground to feast upon the rotting innards. They also interrupt funerals, using magic to distract the attendees and stealing the corpses from their coffins while nobody is looking. Because of these behaviors, they are especially troublesome, and so special methods have been invented to prevent such disturbances to the deceased.\n\nMōryō are afraid of oak trees and tigers. As a result of this, in ancient China it was common to plant oak trees in graveyards, and to adorn the roads leading into and out of graveyards with stone tigers. Additionally, prior to interring a casket in the ground, a servant would enter the grave hold and prod around with a spear to make sure no mōryō were hiding in the grave. These practices did not catch on in Japan.\n\nOrigin: Mōryō first appear in ancient Chinese records, where they are said to be minor nature spirits or demons. In Japan, they are said to be water kami, and cooperate alongside chimi, minor kami of the mountains. Many kinds of yokai can be classified as mōryō, one of the most famous examples being the kappa.\n\nLegends: In Mimibukuro, a collection of folktales collected during the Edo period, a story of a mōryō disguised as a human is recorded. A government official named Shibata had a very loyal servant, who one evening, out of the blue, informed Shibata that he would be leaving his service. When asked why, the man replied that he was not actually a human, but a mōryō in disguise, and his turn had come up to steal corpses; thus, the next day he would have to travel to a nearby village and due his duty as a mōryō. Sure enough, the next day, the servant had vanished, and at the same time, in the village he had mentioned, dark clouds suddenly descended upon a funeral service. When the clouds cleared away, the corpse was missing from the coffin!\n\n",

They wear little boys’ kimonos and wide-brimmed hats — the typical outfit of a tōfu-selling young boy of the Edo period. They are usually depicted with two eyes, but in some illustrations they appear as having only one eye. They are usually found in urban areas in close proximity to people.\n\nBehavior: Tōfu kozō are timid and weak yokai, and are not known to be aggressive towards humans. On rare occasions, a tōfu kozō may follow a human home on a rainy night, but for the most part they shy away from any confrontation.\n\nInteractions: Tōfu kozō are first and foremost servant yokai. Even among other yokai, they are often bullied and teased for their lack of strength. They get no respect from those above them; at most, they act as menial servants to more powerful yokai.\n\nOrigin: Prior to the Edo period there are no known stories about tōfu kozō, and so their origin is a mystery. Some say that they are just one of many forms taken by an itachi, a shape-shifting weasel yokai. Others say that they are the offspring of a mikoshi-nyūdō and a rokuro-kubi. Another possibility is that they are an invention of a creative artist looking to sell illustrated storybooks. Stories of tōfu kozō first appeared in the penny-novels and pulp fiction of Edo in the 1770’s, and became incredibly popular among the Edo upper class. These silly stories helped to spawn the explosion of yokai-related fiction that appeared in the later half of the 18th century.\n\nTōfu kozō bears a very strong resemblance to another yokai called hitotsume kozō — the chief difference being that hitotsume kozō has only one eye and a very large tongue, while tōfu kozō has two eyes and carries a plate of tofu. Both of these yokai are somewhat weak, child-like creatures who act as messengers to more powerful monsters. In some literature the two yokai are used interchangeably for each other, therefore it has been suggested that tōfu kozō may be closely related to, or may even have been copied from hitotsume kozō. However, there is not enough evidence either way to say where this yokai comes from.\n\n",

He looks like a cross between a spiny lobster (Panulirus japonicus) and a brave samurai.\n\nOrigin: Ise Ebizō appears in Tatsu no miyako sentakubanashi: imotako no yurai (“Tales from the Dragon Palace: The Origin of Imotako”), a comical story published in 1791 which depicts the political drama of the undersea court. His name is a pun, based on the Japanese name for the spiny lobster (ise ebi) and Ichikawa Ebizō, a popular kabuki actor’s name.\n\nLegends: Ise Ebizō was a loyal and faithful advisor to the dragon king Ryūō VII for many years. However, one day he spoke out in court against the evil schemes of the dragon king’s closest advisor, an octopus. The octopus convinced the king to dismiss Ise Ebizō, and Ise Ebizō went into exile.\n\nEventually the dragon king Ryūō VII passed. The new king, Ryūō VIII, was only a child, so the son of Otohime and Urashima Tarō, Mizue Kotarō, was named regent. The octopus was hated by the rest of the court, and without the protection of the king his life was in danger. He fled to a distant fortress and raised an army of sharks and whales with the intent of attacking Ryūgū.\n\nThe regent remembered Ise Ebizō’s honor and loyalty to the former king, and he restored his position at court. At the same time, he did not forget the octopus’ treachery and disloyalty. They set a trap for the octopus, luring him back to Ryūgū with the promise of honors and rewards for his service. Then they sprinkled ash all over the palace floor. When the octopus arrived, his feet could not grip the ashy floor, and he was unable to move. Ise Ebizō stepped forth and challenged the octopus. The octopus desperately tried to swim away, but he was no match for the spiny lobster. In a masterful display of swordsmanship, Ise Ebizō cut the octopus into pieces.\n\n",

It depicts an oni wearing monk’s clothing and performing winter training.\n\nBehavior: Kannebutsu is a part of Buddhist religious training. It involves getting up before dawn on winter mornings and patrolling the streets loudly reciting prayers (nenbutsu). Oftentimes devotees bang a gong while repeating the name of Buddha, and visit house to house to collect alms. It is performed by ascetics and laypeople alike.\n\nOrigin: Ōtsu was a major station on both the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō roads connecting Edo with the rest of the country. It is also home to a number of important religious sites, including Enryaku-ji, Mii-dera, and Hiyoshi Taisha. A great number of travelers passed through the city, and it was an important destination for religious pilgrims. Ōtsu-e (“paintings from Ōtsu”) were produced by Ōtsu’s residents and sold as souvenirs and as protective charms to pilgrims and travelers visiting the city. These paintings became immensely popular during the Edo Period. They depicted a number of common themes, usually with a moral or satirical meaning. Oni no kannebutsu is one of the most well known and popular Ōtsu-e themes. Traditionally, oni no kannebutsu pictures were sold as a remedy for colicky children who cry all night long.\n\nThe oni is depicted wearing monk’s robes and looks ready to perform winter training. He carries a gong, a wooden mallet, and a donation registry. The only thing he is missing is a clean soul. It is said that an oni’s residence is the human heart. Their horns are the manifestation of the three poisons of Buddhism which are the root of all evil: delusion, attachment, and hatred. The more we express our ego, use things for our benefit, see things through our own eyes, and act in our own self interest, the more our horns grow. The oni in monk’s garb is similar in meaning to a wolf in sheep’s clothing. The painting is a satire of monks and priests who dress and act pious, but who actually behave in a manner more fitting an oni than a buddha. This kind of comical depiction of religious hypocrisy is a theme frequently found in yōkai art.\n\nThere is a hidden message in oni no kannebutsu. One of the oni’s horns is broken. In other words, this oni may be trying to break out of its self-delusion. The broken horn shows that it has succeeded to some degree, serving as a role model and a reminder for viewers to do the same. So on one level, the image is a caricature of religious hypocrisy, but on another level, it can be seen as a reminder of the path to salvation.\n\n",

A fisherman named Yazaimon happened to pass by, and when he saw the enormous octopus his mouth began to water. Yazaimon climbed up onto the boulder and carefully cut off one of the octopus’ legs while it slept.\n\nThe following day Yazaimon passed the same boulder. The giant octopus was there, once again taking a nap. For a second time, Yazaimon climbed up onto the boulder and cut off one of the octopus’ legs.\n\nThis happened every day for a week. Finally the octopus had only one leg left. On the eigth day, Yazaimon climbed the boulder with the intention of killing the octopus and taking its last leg. But this time, the octopus woke up. It was furious. The octopus wrapped its remaining leg around Yazaimon and slid down to the bottom of the sea, dragging Yazaimon down with it. Then it resumed its nap.\n\nAfterwards the giant, one-legged octopus was dubbed yazaimondako, after the man who took seven of its legs.\n\n",

They have soft and flabby bodies with a gelatinous consistency reminiscent of konnyaku jelly.\n\nInteractions: Biron aren’t particularly harmful yōkai. They enjoy scaring humans by caressing the heads and necks of their victims with their long tails. They can be easily dealt with by throwing salt at them, which causes them to vanish.\n\nOrigin: Biron’s origins are shrouded in mystery. Supposedly, it is the result of a magical mishap. It tried transform into the shape of a buddha by chanting, “Biro! Biro! Biro~n!” But the spell failed, resulting in biron’s strange appearance.\n\nThe oldest written record for biron is a 1972 yōkai encyclopedia by Satō Arifumi. Along with its illustration and description, he notes that it is also called nuribotoke. During an interview late in his life, Satō claimed that biron and its magical spell were recorded in a Heian or Edo Period picture scroll. It was later reproduced in an Edo Period booklet containing reproductions of Toriyama Sekien and other artists’ yōkai illustrations. Unfortunately Satō could no longer remember the name of his source book or its whereabouts, and ultimately he was not able to shed any light on its origins before his death. Other yōkai researchers have never found the book he described. Additionally, the ～ character in biron’s name was not used during the period in which it was said to have originated, adding some mystery to his claim. With no surviving older sources, biron is thought to be a creation of Satō Arifumi.\n\n",

They are formless spirits invisible to the human eye. Their true, unseen forms are often depicted in art as a myriad of grotesque monsters resembling oni. On rare occasions when yakubyō gami appear to humans, they often take the form of elderly priests or old hags.\n\nMany kinds of yakubyō gami exist—for example, amazake babā, bake kujira, kaze no kami, keukegen, korōri, momonjii, and yonaki babā, to name a few.\n\nBehavior: Yakubyō gami travel from person to person and place to place, spreading sickness and misfortune wherever they go. They haunt a single person or a household for a short time. Once their victims have been infected, they move on to a new target.\n\nInteractions: People have invented many ways to protect themselves from yakubyō gami. Images of protective spirits—such as amabie, baku, hakutaku, hōnengame, jinja hime, kotobuki, Shōki, and so on—were often hung in houses with the belief that they would ward off yakubyō gami. Buddhist and Shinto talismans—omamori and ofuda—were also used in this way. Holy ropes called shimenawa were strung around trees at the borders of villages to prevent evil spirits from entering.\n\nIn eastern Japan, on the eighth night of the second and twelfth months in the old lunisolar calendar, two yōkai—hitotsume kozō and mikari baba—would travel from house to house to record people’s misdeeds. Their report would be given to a yakubyō gami who would then come down to each village and apportion misfortune and sickness based on the report. One-eyed yōkai like hitotsume kozō were said to fear objects with many “eyes”—such as sieves and baskets—and so these were hung outside of homes on these nights to scare them away and prevent them from reporting anything to the yakubyō gami.\n\nPeople have also tried to discourage appease yakubyō gami by honoring them as gods. Offerings of food were regularly performed by priests and government officials in an effort to prevent epidemics. Many of today’s popular festivals and celebrations have their roots in rituals designed to appease yakubyō gami.\n\nOrigin: Yakubyō gami are historically among the most feared yōkai of all. They frequently appeared in folklore and art during the second half of the 19th century when several epidemics struck Japan. However, the belief that sickness and misfortune are caused by invisible spirits has always been a central part of Japanese folklore. Before germ theory revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases, people had no knowledge of microorganisms that cause disease. The way sickness spread from person to person must have seemed very much like an invisible spirit was traveling from house to house and infecting people.\n\nLegends: In 1820 in Edo, a samurai managed to capture a yakubyō gami as it was trying to enter his house. In exchange for its freedom, the spirit promised to spare everyone in the samurai’s family from sickness and misfortune. It gave him a written contract agreeing to never try to enter the samurai’s house again. Afterwards, the samurai’s story and the entire contents of the contract were circulated widely in the newspapers with the instructions to use it as a talisman. Before long, houses all over Edo each had their own printed copy of the yakubyō gami’s contract.\n\n",

It is named for the distinctive sound it makes, crying out from the darkness: “Uwan!” No written record of its physical appearance exists; the creature was thought to be formless for centuries. It wasn’t until the Edo period when artist Sawaki Sūshi gave the creature its shape that uwan were considered anything more than phantom sounds.\n\nInteractions: Uwan are occasionally encountered outside of old buildings and temples. They assault lone passersby by leaping out of the shadows and shouting “Uwan!” The uwan depends entirely on the surprise attack—any weak-willed victims who faint at the site of the uwan never regain consciousness. The uwan steals their essence and flees into the darkness. However, if a brave individual shouts back “Uwan!” then this yōkai flees and never bothers that person again.\n\nLegends: A famous uwan encounter took place in Akita Prefecture during the Edo period. A young newlywed couple had bought an old mansion and moved in together. On their first night in their new house, they were awoken by a loud voice shouting “UWAN!” The shocked couple searched all over and around the house, but couldn’t find the source of the voice. The shouting continued for some time, erupting sporadically all night, every night. The couple was not able to sleep at all.\n\nSome time later, the couple’s neighbors began to ask why they were always so tired-looking, with blood-shot eyes and disheveled hair. The husband tried to explain about the mysterious voice, but none of his neighbors claimed to have heard the shouting. Of course, nobody in the neighborhood believed the couple. Instead, gossip quickly began to spread that the newlyweds weren’t getting any sleep on account of nocturnal activity of a different kind. Embarrassed, the couple ceased asking about the strange sounds.\n\n",

Ryūjin can refer to any dragon that is worshiped as a local kami, including major dragons such as the hachidai ryūō, Zennyō Ryūō, Kuzuryū, Seiryū, and so on. But when it is used as a proper title (i.e. Ryūjin) it most commonly refers to the dragon god of the sea—Watatsumi in Shintō tradition or Shagara Ryūō in Buddhist tradition.\n\nBehavior: Like other dragons, ryūjin commonly make their homes in caves, rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Landforms inhabited by a local ryūjin usually have shrines dedicated to them somewhere nearby.\n\nThe dragon god of the sea Ryūjin lives in Ryūgū, a great palace made of fish scales and coral located (depending on the tradition) at the bottom of Lake Biwa, on the ocean’s floor, or across the distant horizon. He keeps a royal court full of sea creatures who serve him just as human nobles would serve a king in the surface world.\n\nInteractions: Dragons interact with humans in similar ways to other powerful spirits. They can be benevolent kami or tyrannical monsters. They may bestow gifts upon nearby settlements when the locals please them, but when displeased they may summon rainstorms or floods to punish humans. The worst of them even demand human sacrifices or take women from their families to be their brides. The term ryūjin refers mainly to those benevolent dragons who help mankind, or those who were pacified and who promised to no longer do harm. Shrines are built in their honor, and they are worshiped as gods of agriculture and fishing, and guardians of the land.\n\nSea creatures act as Ryūjin’s servants and emissaries, delivering his messages to humanity—including prophecies of bumper harvests or warnings about upcoming disasters. Ryūjin’s daughters—Otohime, Toyotama hime and Tamayori hime, or Zennyo Ryūō, depending on the tradition—occasionally interact directly with humans as well.\n\nRyūjin sometimes lends or gives treasures to humans to help them accomplish great deeds—for example, the bottomless sack of rice given by Ryūjin to Fujiwara no Hidesato in return for slaying an ōmukade.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of Ryūjin’s gifts are the tide-controlling jewels kanju (干珠) and manju (満珠). With these pearl-like treasures, a person can cause the tides to recede (kanju) or rise (manju) dramatically. They appear in several legends and folktales. When Ryūjin’s son in law Hoori fought his brother Hoderi, Hoori was able to use manju to nearly drown his brother and force him to submit. During the legendary 3rd century Empress Jingū’s invasion of the Korean peninsula, she used kanju to lower the ocean and strand the enemy’s ships on the sea floor. Then she used manju to raise the water and destroy the stranded fleet.\n\nLegends: Long ago, Ryūjin’s daughter Otohime fell gravely ill. The royal doctors said that she could be cured by medicine made from the liver of a living monkey. Of all the sea creatures, only the turtle is able to climb onto the land where monkeys live. So Ryūjin sent a turtle to the surface world to bring down a living monkey.\n\nThe turtle swam to shore and soon found a monkey up in a tree. The turtle told the monkey that Ryūjin was holding a feast in Ryūgū, and the monkey was invited. The monkey replied that he had always wanted to visit Ryūgū. The turtle told the monkey to climb onto his shell, and then he carried the monkey down to the dragon palace.\n\nAt Ryūgū, the monkey was treated to a feast the likes of which he had never experienced. There was singing and dancing, and more food and sake than he could imagine. The monkey feasted and drank so heavily that soon he collapsed in a drunken haze. But the doctors reminded Ryūjin that the liver had to be extracted from a living monkey—a dead one would not do. So Ryūjin ordered his servants to take the monkey outside and sober him up.\n\nThe royal guards—a jellyfish and a flounder—carried the monkey outside to the courtyard. As they dragged the monkey’s semi-conscious body, they laughed to themselves, “What a stupid monkey! He doesn’t even know that we’re going to cut out his liver.” But the monkey was still semi-conscious, and he heard what they said. He pulled himself up onto his feet and told the guards he needed to speak to the turtle.\n\nWhen the turtle arrived, the monkey told him, “Oh, turtle! I just remembered something terrible! When you found me, I was hanging my liver on a tree branch to dry. I was so excited to come to the party that I left it behind. And it looks like it might rain… If my liver gets wet it will be ruined! Please, take me back to the shore so I can get my liver.”\n\n“If the monkey’s liver were ruined, it would be a disaster,” thought the turtle. So he quickly carried the monkey on his shell back to the shore. Once on land, the monkey climbed up into a tree and stayed there. The turtle called up to ask if he found his liver. The monkey shouted down at the turtle, “You idiot! A liver is not something you hang from a tree! I overheard the jellyfish and the flounder talking about your plan, and I will never return to the sea again!” Then the monkey started hurling rocks at the turtle. One of them chipped his shell.\n\nThe turtle retreated back to Ryūgū and reported what happened to Ryūjin. The dragon king was so angry that he cut the flounder’s body in two, and he pulled all of the bones out of the jellyfish’s body. Then he banished them from Ryūgū forever. That is why jellyfish must float about near the surface, and why flounders must lie flat on their sides.\n\n",

Hoping that the appearance of this creature was an auspicious sign, the newspapers dubbed the creature “hōnengyo.”\n\nAlthough it is referred to as a fish, its description and illustration more closely resemble an enormous amphibian or aquatic mammal. The Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) can grow up to 1.5 meters long and lives in rivers. It has been speculated that the hōnengyo of the Yodo River may have been a giant salamander which wandered down from the mountains, or a seal which wandered up from the ocean.\n\nHōnengyo has also gained attention due to the Edo Period illustration’s similarity to the Shōwa Era movie monster Godzilla, who appeared in theaters almost 90 years after hōnengyo’s newspaper debut.\n\n",

Visually they appear no different than ordinary owls. Tatarimokke remain near the homes of the families they once belonged to. The hooting of the owls is said to actually be the sound created by the spirit of the dead baby.\n\nInteractions: Tatarimokke are treated with respect by the families which they haunt, just like zashiki warashi. Houses that have lost a child recently will take care of any owls that appear near their homes and treat them as if they are the spirit of the lost child. In most cases, these spirits are beloved by the families they haunt, and they do not cause any harm.\n\nIn some cases, however, tatarimokke can be dangerous to people. The souls of babies whose bodies were carelessly discarded into rivers, babies who were killed by their parents to reduce the number of mouths to feed, and even the spirits of aborted fetuses could retain a grudge against the living. People passing through the places where these resentful spirits haunt might hear eerie sounds and feel unsettling sensations, see strange phenomena like floating fireballs, or may stumble on a rock and hurt themselves.\n\nIn the most extreme cases, tatarimokke truly do bring terrible curses upon those who are perceived as having wronged them. Particularly in the case of people who were murdered in particularly violent and gruesome fashion. In these cases, the tatarimokke is not the spirit of a newborn baby, but instead is the spirit of the murder victim. These tatarimokke lay a curse their assailant so powerful that it not only brings ruin to the murderer, but to his entire family, for generations to come.\n\nOrigin: Long ago in Japan, babies were not considered fully human until some time after they were born. Therefore, when a newborn died, it was not given a proper funeral and placed in a cemetery, but was usually buried quietly in or around the house. The spirits of these children would float out, and were believed to easily get “stuck” to owls, thus becoming a tatarimokke.\n\nThe name tatarimokke comes from tatari (curse) and moke, which means “infant” in some northern dialects. It is usually written phonetically, but is sometimes also written with characters that mean “curse” and “frog.” In this case, the character for frog is actually read as “moke,” and refers to the local word for a newborn baby.\n\n",

From afar, jubokko appear to be ordinary trees, indistinguishable from the various species that dot the landscape. It takes an observant eye to notice the slightly more fearsome features of its branches, or the piles of human bones buried in the undergrowth beneath the tree.

Thereafter, the trees thirst only for human blood.\n\nBehavior: Jubokko wait for unsuspecting humans to pass underneath their branches. When somebody gets close enough, they attack, snatching their prey with long, jagged, finger-like branches, and hoisting it into their boughs. These branches pierce the skin of their victims, sucking out all of the blood with special tube-like twigs. After the body is drained, the flesh and organs are consumed by birds, insects, and other animals. Only the dry bones fall back to earth.

Their teeth chatter and bones rattle with the “gachi gachi” sound of this yōkai’s namesake. But they are not always noisy. If they should happen upon a human out late on the roads, the gashadokuro will silently creep up and catch their victims, crushing them in their hands or biting off their head.\n\nOrigin: Soldiers whose bodies rot in the fields and victims of famine who die unknown in the wilderness rarely receive proper funerary rites. Unable to pass on, their souls are reborn as ghosts, longing eternally for that which they once had. These people die with anger and pain in their hearts. That energy remains long after their flesh has rotted from their bones. As their bodies decay, their anger ferments into a grudge against the living, which twists them into a supernatural force. When the bones of hundreds of victims gather together into one mass, they form the humongous, skeletal monster known as the gashadokuro.\n\nToo large and powerful to be killed, gashadokuro maintain their existence until the energy and malice stored up in their bodies has completely burnt out. However, because of the large amount of dead bodies required to form a single one, these abominations are rarer today than they were in the past, when wars and famine were a part of everyday life.\n\nLegends: The earliest record of a gashadokuro goes back over 1000 years to a bloody rebellion against the central government by a samurai named Taira no Masakado. His daughter Takiyasha hime was a famous sorceress. When Masako was eventually killed for his revolt, his daughter continued his cause. Using her black magic, she summoned a great skeleton from the bodies of dead soldiers to attack the city of Kyōto. Her monster is depicted in a famous print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi.\n\n",

The name is used in a euphemistic way; while some ōnyūdō bear a strong resemblance to Buddhist priests and monks, most have no actual relation to the clergy. Size, appearance, and mannerisms vary from region to region and account to account. Some giants are only slightly larger than a human while others are as big as a mountain. Some are saviors of men, while others are man-eaters.\n\nBehavior: Ōnyūdō can be separated into four general groups: those that harm humans; those that help humans; transformations of other yōkai; and other, truly unique ōnyūdō that do not fit into any of these categories.\n\nŌnyūdō that harm humans are by far the broadest category. Among them are well-known yōkai, such as hitotsume nyūdō, mikoshi nyūdō, and the ocean going umi bōzu. These giants delight in terrorizing humans— sometimes hunting them to eat, sometimes pillaging and destroying villages out of rage, and other times terrifying lone travelers just for the fun of it.\n\nŌnyūdō that help humans are much rarer. They have been known to perform good deeds such as turning stuck waterwheels, moving heavy objects, or doing other things that require incredible amounts of strength. Though helpful, they are not always friendly. Ōnyūdō can change from benevolent to violent with little warning.\n\nHelpful or harmful, true ōnyūdō are actually rare. Transformed yōkai—especially tanuki and itachi—make up a large percentage of the giant population. Shape-shifting yōkai take on giant form in order to scare people and cause mischief, though they rarely kill. There is no easy way to identify if a giant is a true ōnyūdō or just a shape-shifter. The two are functionally indistinguishable.\n\nAnd then there are the remainder of the ōnyūdō—enigmatic and mysterious. They are only evidenced by their footprints or discarded trash. Regardless of how good or evil at heart a particular ōnyūdō is, they are by nature extremely dangerous. It is generally wise to leave them be. Better to avoid all contact with them than risk enraging an ōnyūdō and bringing destruction upon nearby villages.\n\n",

They have the bodies of large turtles, with broad, hairy tails protruding from their shells. They have the heads of human women with long, flowing black hair.

They rarely every appear before humans, coming to shore only when they have an important message to deliver.\n\nInteractions: Hōnengame approach humans in order to give predictions and prophecies. Usually they foretell great harvests, which is why they are called hōnengame. They may also warn of coming epidemics, droughts, famines, and other disasters. Like amabie, jinja hime, and other prophetic seafaring yōkai, their image was believed to have powerful protective abilities. Hōnengame illustrations printed in newspapers or sold as talismans and charms were believed to ward against disease and evil spirits.\n\nOrigin: Hōnengame were first recorded in the Edo Period. In 1669, a hōnengame calling itself kame onna appeared on the shores of Echigo Province (present day Niigata Prefecture). Its body glowed brilliantly, which attracted a number of people. As they approached, the creature spoke to them. It foretold a bumper crop which would be followed by an epidemic. It also informed the people that if they were to hang its image in their homes and pray to it morning and night, they would avoid getting sick. Then she slipped back into the sea and was not seen again.\n\nA newspaper from 1839 describes that on the 14th day of the 7th month, a hōnengame was captured alive by fishermen in Kishū (present day Wakayama and Mie Prefectures). It was recorded as having a girth of 5.5 meters and a length of 1.71 meters. Its image was circulated and used as a talisman against evil.\n\n",

He controls heat and flame. The ancient capitals of Fujiwara-kyō, Heijo-kyō and Heian-kyō were each guarded on the south by a large gate called Suzakumon (Suzaku Gate). Beyond Suzakumon was a wide avenue called Suzaku Boulevard, which served as the main north-south road. In Kyoto, this road ran from the Imperial Palace to the gate at the southern end of the city, Rashōmon. Today, though the gates are long gone, Suzaku Boulevard (now called Senbon Avenue) remains an important road in the city.\n\nOrigin: Suzaku and the other shijin were brought to Japan from China in the 7th century CE. They are strongly associated with Taoism, feng shui, astrology, the five element theory, and other forms of Chinese mysticism. Japan’s ancient capitals were built in correspondence to these beliefs, with each of the quadrants of the city dedicated to one of the Four Symbols.

The attributes and symbolism of one are sometimes mixed or swapped with each other.

The story has been adapted many times over the centuries, with the names, places, and other details changing across different adaptations. Ehon hyaku monogatari places the story in Yamanashi Prefecture, at the base of Mount Atago. The kyōgen theater piece Tsurigitsune is based on a 14th century version of this story from Shōrinji, a temple in Sakai, Osaka.\n\nLegends: Long ago lived a trapper named Yasaku. He made his living by trapping foxes and selling their pelts in the market. An old, silver furred kitsune lived in the mountains where Yasaku worked. He had lost his friends and family members, one by one, to Yasaku’s traps until only he remained. He decided he would teach the trapper a lesson.\n\nThe kitsune knew that Yasaku’s uncle was a monk named Hakuzōsu. The kitsune disguised himself as Hakuzōsu and paid Yasaku a visit. He scolded him for hunting foxes, preaching the Buddhist precept that killing any living being is a grave sin. He referenced the story of Tamamo no Mae, whose sins caused her to be transformed into a boulder as a punishment. He even gave Yasaku some money in exchange for the rest of his snares. Finally Yasaku promised to stop killing foxes. Pleased with his success, the kitsune skipped back into the forest.\n\nHowever, the money was not enough to support Yasaku’s lifestyle. He quickly spent all that the kitsune had given him. He decided to travel to his uncle’s temple to ask for more money. The old kitsune discovered Yasaku’s plan, and realized that his deception would be discovered. He went to the temple ahead of Yasaku and located Hakuzōsu. He lured Hakuzōsu away from the safety of the temple and devoured him. The kitsune once again disguised himself as the old monk. When Yasaku arrived to ask for money, the kitsune disguised as Hakuzōsu scolded him and sent him away empty handed.\n\nFor the next fifty years, the kitsune lived at the temple, disguised as Hakuzōsu, and faithfully performed the old monk’s duties.\n\nOne day, a deer hunt took place at a nearby farm. Many people traveled to the farm to witness the hunt. Hakuzōsu (the kitsune) went to spectate as well. At the farm, two dogs belonging to a samurai sensed the kitsune’s true identity. The leaped upon Hakuzōsu and ripped him to pieces. When the dogs were finally called off of the old monk, the torn body of an old, silver-furred kitsune was discovered and Hakuzōsu’s true form was exposed.\n\nThe villagers, fearing that the kitsune’s spirit would return and curse them, buried the body in the shade of a nearby mountain, and erected a small shrine over it.\n\n",

Aside from their unparalleled grace and elegance, and supernaturally attractive faces and figures, there is little way to differentiate them from ordinary women. They wear beautiful gowns called hagoromo (literally “feather cloth”), which allow them to fly.\n\nBehavior: Tennyo are servants and courtesans for the emperor of heaven, and companions of buddhas and bodhisattvas. They sing, dance, play music, recite poetry, and do much of the same things as their earthly counterparts in human imperial courts; though they do them all with more grace, refinement, and beauty. They aid and entertain the other inhabitants of heaven, and they even occasionally fly down to earth to visit.\n\nOrigin: Tennyo are a female-only subgroup of tennin, one of many celestial races native to Tendō. They are based on the Indian apsaras, celestial nymphs from Hindu and Buddhist mythology. They were brought to China from India along with Buddhism, where they developed into the tennyo we know today. The Chinese Buddhist tennyo was later brought over to Japan.\n\nLegends: Tennyo are a popular subject of folklore throughout all of Japan. Legends often involve love stories and marriage between tennyo and human men. The most famous story is the Noh play Hagoromo.\n\nLong ago, in what is today Shizuoka, a fisherman named Hakuryō was walking along the pine-covered beaches of the Miho peninsula. It was a beautiful spring morning, and Hakuryō stopped for a moment to admire the beautiful white sand, the sparkling waves, the fluffy clouds, and the fishing ships on the bay. A pleasant fragrance filled the air, and it seemed that ethereal music was dancing on the winds. Something caught his eye; draped over a nearby pine branch was a robe of the most splendid fabric he had ever seen. It was made of a soft, feathery material, and was woven in fantastic colors, so he decided to take it home and keep it as a family heirloom.\n\nJust as Hakuryō was preparing to leave, a young woman of breathtaking beauty appeared in the nude before him. She had flowers in her hair, and smelled just as beautiful as she looked. She said that he was holding her hagoromo robe, and asked him to return it. Hakuryō realized that this beautiful maiden was a tennyo. He refused to return to robe, saying it would bring good luck and fortune to his village.\n\nThe woman grew sad, and lamented that she would not be able to fly home to heaven without her robe. She dropped to her knees and cried, her tears falling like beautiful pearls into the sand. The flowers in her hair wilted. She looked up at the clouds above, and heard a flock of geese flying by, which only saddened her more as they reminded her of the celestial karyōbinga birds back home in heaven.\n\nHakuryō was moved by the beautiful maiden’s sadness. He told her that he would return her robe, but first she must perform a celestial dance for him. She agreed to perform the dance, but told Hakuryō that she needed her hagoromo to perform the dance. Hakuryō refused to return the robe. He thought she would just fly off to heaven without performing for him. The tennyo replied to him that deception was a part of his world, not hers, and that her kind do not lie. Hakuryō  felt shame, and returned the dress to her.\n\nThe tennyo donned her hagoromo and performed the dance of the Palace of the Moon. She was accompanied by celestial music, flutes, koto, and the wind in the pines. The moon shown through the trees and sweet fragrances filled the air. The waves grew calm and peaceful. Her long sleeves danced upon the wind, and she danced in sheer joy. As she danced, she slowly floated up into the sky. She flew over the beach, higher and higher, above the pines, through the clouds, and beyond the top of Mt. Fuji. She disappeared into the mists of heaven.\n\n",

The constellations which make up the snake’s tail are located in PEgasus and Andromeda.\n\nInteractions: Genbu is one of the shijin, or Four Symbols, which are important mythological figures in Taoism. Genbu is the guardian of the north. He is associated with the Chinese element of water, the season of winter, the planet Mercury, and the color black. He represents the virtue of knowledge. He controls the cold. He is enshrined in the Genbu Shrine, north of Kyoto’s Imperial Palace.\n\nOrigin: Genbu is named differently than the other shijin; rather than directly describing a color and animal, i.e. Black Tortoise, his name is written as gen, meaning dark, occult, or mysterious, and bu, meaning warrior. The word tortoise is not used for his name, because it was also used as a slur in China. So this euphemistic name was used to refer to the Black Tortoise. His name comes from Chinese mythology, where it is with the Taoist god Xuan Wu (the Chinese pronunciation of Genbu). Xuan Wu was a prince who lived in prehistoric northern China. He lived in the mountains, far from civilization, where he studied Taoism as an ascetic. He learned that to achieve full divinity, he would have to purge both his mind and body of all impurities. While his mind had become enlightened, he still had to eat earthly food, and so sin remained in his stomach and his intestines. So he cut them out and washed them in a river to purify them. When he did this, his stomach turned into a large demon tortoise and his intestines into a demon snake. The demons began to terrorize the countryside. Xuan Wu subdued them, and instead of destroying them he allowed them to atone for their sins by serving him. They became his generals: a snake and a tortoise. It is these two generals which became Xuan Wu’s—and Genbu’s—symbols.\n\nGenbu is associated with yin energy—the forces of darkness and shadow—and in ancient China was worshipped as a god of the moon (another strong yin force) in addition to being the god of the north. Because the shell of a tortoise is like a suit of armor, Genbu is also viewed as a warrior deity. The tortoise shell is a symbol of heaven and earth, with the flat part of the lower shell representing the world and the dome of the upper shell representing the heavens. As tortoise shells were a popular tool in divination, Genbu was also viewed as having soothsaying powers and the ability to travel between the lands of the living and the dead. The tortoise is a symbol of longevity and immortality, while the snake is a symbol of reproduction and multiplication. It was believed that all tortoises were female and had to mate with a snake to reproduce. The intertwining of the two was a symbol not only of long life and fertility, but also of the balance of yin and yang.\n\nIn later centuries, as belief in onmyōdō waned, the Four Symbols were gradually replaced by the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism. Genbu and his symbols were largly absorbed and supplanted by the Buddhist king Tamonten.\n\n",

It is found across East Asian folklore.\n\nOrigin: A three-legged crow has been used as a symbol of the sun since neolithic times in China. It may have originated as a personification of sunspots by ancient astronomers. In Japan, the crow has also been a symbol of the sun since ancient times, appearing in Japan’s earliest written works. It is a holy creature and a servant of the sun goddess, Amaterasu. The name Yatagarasu means “eight span crow.” One “span” was the length between the outstretched thumb and middle finger—roughly 18 centimeters—but this moniker is mainly just a poetic way to say “very large.” Originally Yatagarasu was depicted with two legs, but in the 930’s CE, the Chinese myth of the three-legged crow was merged into the story of Yatagarasu. Since then, Yatagarasu and the three-legged crow have been synonymous with each other.\n\nThe three-legged crow has long been used in religious and astrological symbolism across China and Japan, particularly among those involved with sun worship and onmyōdō. The three legs of the bird represent heaven, the earth, and humanity, while the crow itself represents the sun. This symbolizes that heaven, earth, and mankind all come from the same sun, and are like brothers to each other. They are also said to represent the three virtues of the gods: wisdom, benevolence, and valor. The three legs may also represent the three powerful clans of ancient Kumano—Ui, Suzuki, and Enomoto—who use a three-legged crow as their clan crest.\n\nLegends: Yatagarasu is an important figure in the mythical history of Japanese. According to the Kojiki, Japan’s oldest written history, Yatagarasu is an incarnation of the god Kamo Taketsunumi—today enshrined in Kyoto’s Shimogamo Shrine. As Yatagarasu, he led Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan, through the mountains to establish his country.\n\nJimmu’s clan originated in Kyushu, in present-day Miyazaki Prefecture. He and his brothers led an eastward migration from along the Seto Insland Sea, looking for a better homeland, and subduing the various tribes they encountered along the way. They suffered many hardships. When they reached Naniwa (present-day Osaka), Jimmu’s older brother Itsuse, leader of the expedition, was killed in battle. Jimmu realized that they had lost because they were fighting facing eastwards, fighting against the sun. He led his troops around the Kii peninsula, to Kumano (present-day Mie Prefecture), and began a westward push. His expedition became lost in the mountains of Kumano. Seeing this, Amaterasu, the sun goddess, and Takamimusubi, one of the creator gods, ordered Kamo Taketsunumi to act as a guide to Jimmu. Kamo Taketsunumi took the form of a giant crow, and flew to Jimmu’s side to show him the way. With Yatagarasu leading the way, Jimmu was able to navigate the mountains of Kumano and reach Yamato (in present-day Nara Prefecture), where he would found his capital and become Japan’s first emperor.\n\nAccording to legend, Jimmu’s great-grandfather Ninigi was the grandson of Amaterasu. Thus, Jimmu, and the entire Japanese imperial line are the direct descendants of the sun goddess. Yatagarasu, as a guide to Jimmu, played a small roll with a very big impact on the future of the imperial dynasty.\n\n",

They are usually considered to be harmless and leave people alone. However, according to some tales, umi zatō harass fishermen out at sea. They are said to beckon ships towards them, and when the ships draw close, they flip them over and capsize them. They also occasionally swallow entire boats whole. They do have a congenial side, however. If the people on a ship reply to an umi zatō in a polite and docile manner, the umi zatō will vanish and leave them alone.\n\nOrigin: Because there are so few legends about the umi zatō, almost all of what we know about them is only speculation. They are sometimes considered to be cousins of the similar-looking umi-bōzu, but it is very likely that umi zatō is an invented yokai thought up by Edo-period artists solely for decorating old picture scrolls.\n\n",

Short creatures resembling boys of about 10 years of age, their heads are crowned in long brown hair and their bodies are covered in fine, light hair. They have a short torso and two long legs, on which they walk upright. A yamawaro’s most distinguishing feature is the single eye in the middle of its head. They are skillful mimics, copying the sound of falling rocks, wind, dynamite, and tools. They can even learn to speak human languages and sing human songs.\n\nInteractions: Like their cousins the kappa, yamawaro despise horses and cows, and attack them on sight. They love the sport of sumo, which they are better at than any human. Like hyōsube, they sneak into homes to nap and take baths, and leave behind a thick film of grease and hair when they are done.\n\nYamawaro are frequently encountered in the mountains by woodcutters, and are known to help with work. If properly thanked and offered food for their services, a yamawaro is likely to return to help again. However, care must be taken when feeding a yamawaro. If the amount of food is less than what was promised, it will grow angry and never return. If offered before the work is performed, the yamawaro will simply take the food and run.\n\nOrigin: One theory from Kumamoto Prefecture says that yamawaro and garappa are actually different forms of the same yōkai. During the cold months, these creatures live in the mountains as yamawaro (or yamawarawa, as they are known locally). During the warm months, they live in lakes and rivers as garappa. Every year on the autumn equinox, all of the country’s garappa transform into yamawaro and travel from the rivers to the mountains in a mass migration. They return on the spring equinox and transform back into garappa. Villagers who build their houses in the pathway of these massive yōkai migrations are prone to find holes, gashes, and other damage caused by yamawaro angry at having their path blocked. People who witness the springtime return of the yamawaro often catch deadly fevers.\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that these creatures share so many traits in common with one another, and because it is extremely rare to see garappa in the winter. However, it is also possible that these aquatic yōkai go into hibernation during the colder months, and that the similarities between garappa and yamawaro are simply coincidence.\n\n",

They are a breed of tiny, thin, magical foxes, about the size of a rat. They are usually found in the service of sorcerers and fortune tellers. Because of their diminutive size, they can be conveniently hidden on the body, tucked in a sleeve or pocket, or carried inside of a matchbox or a bamboo pipe (from which they get their name).\n\nBehavior: In the wild, kudagitsune behave like other small mammals such as foxes, stoats, and weasels. They keep to themselves and usually remain hidden from humans. Only rarely does a kudagitsune allow itself to be tamed and brought into a human household, where it serves as a magical familiar.\n\nInteractions: Kudagitsune are used by sorcerers in divination rituals and to place curses upon people. They loyally serve not just one person, but the whole family. Families with kudagitsune have the ability to tell fortunes, make prophecies, as well as send their kudagitsune out to haunt their enemies (or the enemies of their clients), causing sickness and ill fortune. As a result, these families are often distrusted or shunned by their neighbors. Households with kudagitsune are known by various names such as kuda mochi, kudaya, kuda tsukai, izuna tsukai and kudashō.\n\nKuda mochi families are able to use their powers to acquire any goods or furnishings that they might want. Therefore, kuda mochi families often become wealthy and powerful very quickly. However, as these families grow, they tend to acquire more and more kudagitsune. These spirits will breed quickly until there are upwards of 75 individual kudagitsune. Keeping too many kudagitsune will bring a family to ruin, as the creatures eat them out of house and home. At the same time, culling them to keep their numbers in check is risky due to their powerful magic, and giving them away to disciples or other families carries its own risks.\n\nOrigin: Kudagitsune originate in the mountain shaman traditions of Nagano Prefecture, but have spread throughout the mountainous regions of central and eastern Japan. Because of their diverse range, they are known by various other names from region to region. The most famous of these is izuna, from Mount Iizuna, a mountain in Nagano Prefecture with ancient ties to Shugendō and folk magic.\n\n",

They appear to be harmless traveling priests or monks, no taller than an ordinary person; but in an instant they grow abnormally tall, with long claws and hair like a wild beast.\n\nBehavior: As soon as a person raises his eyes to look upon a mikoshi nyūdō, the giant grows to an immense height—as tall the observer is able to raise his eyes, and just as fast. This causes the person to look up so high and fast that they lose their balance and tumble backwards. That’s when the mikoshi nyūdō lunges forward and bites their throat out with its teeth.\n\nInteractions: Those unfortunate enough to meet this cruel yōkai usually do not live to tell the tale. Much depends on the person’s reaction. If they try to ignore and walk past the mikoshi nyūdō, the angry giant will crush them or pierce them with bamboo spears and branches. The same fate is met by those who turn and try to run away. People who stare at the mikoshi nyūdō frozen in fear will drop dead on the spot, overcome by its presence.\n\nThe only possible escape is to anticipate the mikoshi nyūdō (thus its name). Meet it face-to-face, eye-to-eye, and show no fear. Then, look from its head down to its feet, rather than starting at the feet and looking up. If done properly, the giant’s power to grow will be sapped. Telling the giant, “You lost! I anticipated your trick!” causes it to vanish in anger, leaving the traveler to pass safely along.\n\nOther forms: Mikoshi nyūdō is a popular form of some shape-shifting animals. In particular, itachi and tanuki transform into these giants in order to hunt humans. Kitsune and mujina are known to occasionally take this form as well, though less often. When a mikoshi nyūdō is result of a transformation, it carries a bucket, a lantern, or some other tool. This tool is where the shape-shifter’s true body is stored. If you can snatch the object away from the giant before it attacks, the spell is broken and the transformed yōkai will be at its captor’s mercy.\n\n",

The constellations which make up his heart, belly, and tail are located in Scorpius. The final constellation makes up his dung, and is located in Sagittarius.\n\nInteractions: Seiryū is one of the shijin, or Four Symbols, which are important mythological figures in Taoism. Seiryū is the guardian of the east. He is associated with the Chinese element of wood, the season of spring, the planet Jupiter, and the colors blue and green. He represents the virtue of benevolence, and symbolizes creativity. He controls the rain. He is enshrined in Kyoto at Kiyomizu Temple, in the eastern part of the city.\n\nOrigin: Seiryū and the other shijin were brought to Japan from China in the 7th century CE. They are strongly associated with Taoism, feng shui, astrology, the five element theory, and other forms of Chinese mysticism. The ancient capitals of Fujiwara-kyō, Heijo-kyō, and Heian-kyō were built in correspondence to these beliefs, with each of the quadrants of the city dedicated to one of the Four Symbols. Excavations of ancient burial mounds in Nara has revealed paintings of Seiryū and the other shijin on the tomb walls.\n\nIn later centuries, belief in astrology waned, and worship of the Four Symbols was gradually supplanted by worship of the Four Heavenly Kings of Buddhism. Their use as symbols, however, continued.\n\n",

As he prunes the tree, the shape of the moon grows smaller and less round until there is almost nothing left, and then the tree slowly grows its branches back — sort of a just-so-story to explain the waxing and waning of the moon.\n\n",

The mallet and mortar as also visible as dark spots on the moon. In China, the rabbit is believed not to be creating mochi, but is instead mixing the medicine of eternal youth.\n\nOrigin: The myth of the rabbit in the moon is very ancient. The earliest written version comes from the Jātaka tales, a 4th century BCE collection of Buddhist legends written in Sanskrit. The legend was brought along with Buddhism from India to China, where it was blended with local folklore. It came to Japan in the 7th century CE from China, where it was again adapted and adjusted to fit local folklore.\n\nThe Japanese word for pounding mochi in a mortar like the rabbit is doing—餅搗き (mochitsuki)—and the word for the full moon—望月 (mochitsuki)—are homophones.\n\nLegends: The Japanese version of the Sanskrit tale appears in Konjaku monogatarishū. A fox, a monkey, and a rabbit were traveling in the mountains when they came across a shabby-looking old man lying along the road. The old man had collapsed from exhaustion while trying to cross the mountains. The three animals felt compassion for the old man, and tried to save him. The monkey gathered fruit and nuts from the trees, the fox gathered fish from the river, and they fed the old man. As hard as he tried, the rabbit, however, could not gather anything of value to give to the old man. Lamenting his uselessness, the rabbit asked the fox and monkey for help in building a fire.  When the fire was built, the rabbit leaped into the flames so that his own body could be cooked and eaten by the old man. When the old man saw the rabbit’s act of compassion, he revealed his true form as Taishakuten, one of the lords of Heaven. Taishakuten lifted up the rabbit and placed it the moon, in order that all future generations could be inspired by the rabbit’s compassionate act. The reason it is sometimes difficult to see the rabbit in the moon is because of the smoke which still billows from the rabbits body, masking his form somewhat.\n\n",

They dress in luxurious robes and travel in enormous, ornate palanquins carried by lesser yōkai or human slaves. Their palanquins are surrounded by a splendid precession fit for a corrupt abbot or a rich lord. The fantastic procession is enough to make most travelers stop and stare, speculating about what nobleman or lady might be riding inside. But when the palanquin stops and a hitotsume nyūdō comes strolling out, it means trouble for any curious gawkers.\n\nBehavior: Hitotsume nyūdō are one of the most demonic types of ōnyūdō. They roam the roads and highways outside of the cities, assaulting lone travelers unfortunate enough to get in their way. Like many giants, they are able to increase and decrease their size at will. They can grow taller than the highest trees and trample forests to crush any who might be hiding within. With their long legs they are faster than any human. Running away is impossible. Like many ōnyūdō, hitotsume nyūdō attacks are blamed on mischievous kitsune or tanuki disguised by transformation magic; and occasionally this is true.\n\nLegends: A legend from Wakayama tells how a man, traveling along a wooded road, came across a splendid procession unlike any he had ever seen. Entranced, he climbed a tree to get a better look. As the procession approached, it stopped just as it reached his tree. There was a frighteningly large palanquin, and out from it stepped a giant, one-eyed monster. The creature went after the man, climbing the tree he was hiding in. In a panic the man swung his sword at the creature. At the moment he did so, the hitotsume nyūdō and the entire procession vanished.\n\nAnother hitotsume nyūdō, frequently seen outside of Kyōto, was said to be the reincarnation of a particularly fierce abbot of Enryaku-ji. Renowned for his strict discipline, in life he was known for expelling lazy monks from his temple. He saw the world as growing increasingly secular and wicked, and he constantly lamented and criticized the corruption and sin of the monks of his day. After his death, it is said he was reincarnated into a yōkai. This allowed him to continue punishing the wicked and impious clergy.\n\n",

They can also produce anything you ask for, either by retrieving it from the sea, or by using the wondrous magical trinkets they possess. Unfortunately, this power often attracts the attention of greedy politicians, who try to steal the Ryūgū nyōbō and make her their own.\n\nOrigin: Ryūgū nyōbō stories are part of a broad genre of folktales concerning marriage between humans and supernatural creatures. The story below comes from Kōchi Prefecture, and similar tales can found in every part of Japan and throughout East Asia. Most Ryūgū nyōbō stories follow the same general pattern while altering various details.\n\nLegends: Long ago, an old man and his son lived in a destitute hut by the sea. At the end of the year they ran out of food, so the son went into the mountains to cut firewood to sell in the market on New Year’s Eve. However, the wood was too green and would not burn, so he was not able to sell any. A fishmonger took pity on the poor young man and offered to trade one of his fish for the firewood. The young man happily exchanged the wood for the fish, and started home.\n\nOn the way back, the fish began to thrash violently. The young man took pity on the poor creature and released it into the sea. When he arrived, his father was waiting with a fire ready to cook whatever he brought back from the market. The old man was surprised to see his son empty-handed, but after hearing what happened he said that he did the right thing.\n\nThat night, the old man and his son sat by the fire, hungry. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. A beautiful young woman entered the hut and said to the young man, “Please, would you take me as your wife?”\n\nThe young man refused. “We are so poor that we don’t even have food for New Year’s. We are in no position for me to take a wife.”\n\nThe beautiful woman clapped her hands three times, and suddenly three bales of rice appeared outside of the house. It was more than enough rice for the new year. The old man and his son were overjoyed, and they welcomed the young woman into their family.\n\nSoon, the story of the miraculous powers of this wife spread through the land. The local lord summoned the young man to his castle. “Have your wife make me a bolt of fabric finer than anyone has been woven,” he ordered. “If she can not, then I shall take your wife instead.”\n\nWhen the young man told his wife of the lord’s command, she clapped her hands three times and produced the finest cloth that had ever been woven.\n\nThe lord was so pleased with the cloth that he wanted to meet the woman who wove it. He summoned the the old man, the son, and the wife. Upon seeing the young woman, he thought she was the most beautiful woman he had ever laid eyes upon. He told them, “I will take this woman as my wife. If you don’t like it, then deliver me one thousand bales of rice immediately.”\n\nThe old man and his son were at a loss. However, the wife clapped her hands three times, and in an instant one thousand bales of rice appeared, neatly stacked.\n\nUpon seeing this, the lord desired the woman even more. “If you won’t give her to me, then bring me something not found in this world!” he demanded.\n\nThe young woman clapped her hand three times. Instantly the room filled with monsters—some with one eye, some with long noses—who gobbled up the lord and all of his retainers.\n\nThe wondrous young bride had been sent from Ryūgū as thanks to the young man for saving the life of the fish.\n\n",

In other versions, he stays for years, and he and Otohime produce a child. And in some tales, due to the difference in their ranks, Urashima Tarō is more like a concubine or a kept man to Otohime.\n\nOrigin: The Urashima Tarō story is one Japan’s oldest and most well-known legends, so Otohime has appeared in countless tales—from ancient fairy tales to modern manga and anime. Storytellers have long used this famous relationship as a jumping off point for comical spin-offs and parodies about the couple and their offspring.\n\nOtohime’s name is actually a title meaning “second princess.” It was improper to refer to royalty by their given names, so she is only known as Otohime, or “the second princess” of the dragon king. Legends don’t usually mention anything about her older sister, but she would have been called Ehime (“first princess”).\n\nOtohime is commonly associated with certain mythological and religious figures. In Shintō, Otohime is often said to be either Toyotama hime or Tamayori hime, the daughters of the sea god Watatsumi. In Buddhism, she is described as the second daughter of Shagara, the dragon king who rules the sea. The similarities between Shintō and Buddhist myths, centuries of syncretism, and the popular retelling of her tales over the years makes separating Otohime’s various origins from each other difficult, if not impossible.\n\n",

A very large sack is slung over their shoulder.\n\nOrigin: Mujina are known to be tricksters, dressing up in various human costumes and masquerading as people. However, because this yōkai originally appears in a collection of tsukumogami, it is likely that fukuro mujina are actually haunted bags which take on the appearance of mujina, rather than mujina pretending to be humans.\n\nFukuro mujina was invented by Toriyama Sekien and appears in his Hyakki tsurezure bukuro, however it was based on illustrations from much older yōkai picture scrolls. Sekien inserts a pun into his description of the fukuro mujina, referring to an old proverb: “to price a badger in a hole.” The meaning of this idiom is that it is difficult to estimate the value of something you do not yet possess. It is similar to the English phrase “to count your chickens before they are hatched.”\n\n",

It looks like a squat humanoid with a large, ugly head like a potato or a stone. It wears a straw-woven raincoat. Abura sumashi are extremely rare, only found deep in the mountains or along mountain passes in the southern parts of Japan—throughout the range where wild tea plants grow.\n\nBehavior: Very little is known about the lifestyle and habits of this reclusive yōkai. The most well-known abura sumashi lives in the Kusazumigoe Pass in Kumamoto, but only ever appears briefly to travelers. Occasionally, an old grandmother walking the pass with her grandchildren will say, “You know, a long time ago, an abura sumashi used to live in these parts.” A mysterious voice will call out in reply, “I still do!” On rare occasions the abura sumashi will appear to the travelers, materializing out of thin air.\n\nOrigin: The name abura sumashi means “oil presser,” and comes from the act of pressing oil out of the seeds of tea plants which grow in Kumamoto. Though its origins are a mystery, it is commonly believed that abura sumashi are the ghosts of oil thieves who escaped into the woods. Oil was a difficult and expensive commodity to make. It required time and hard work to extract it from tea seeds, so its theft was a serious crime. Oil thieves who went unpunished in life reincarnated as abura sumashi—a divine punishment for their sins.\n\n",

They resemble human women, but have many piscine features. Their skin is scaley like a fish, and their fingers and toes are webbed like a waterfowl’s and resemble fins. Their teeth are sharp and brilliant, like a shark’s. They are very strong, and very dangerous.\n\nBehavior: Umi nyōbō spend most of their time in the oceans. However, they are able to survive on land for several days without returning to sea. According to an entry for umi nyōbō in the Yamato honzō, a biology encyclopedia written in 1709, they are unable to speak. However, many folk tales depict umi nyōbō who are able to speak.\n\nInteractions: Folk tales from fishing villages describe umi nyōbō as fearsome predators who kill and eat humans for pleasure. However, this is not always the case. While they do prey on humans, it appears that they do have a sense of compassion as well, and can occasionally show kindness towards humans.\n\nOrigin: Umi nyōbō originates in the Izumo region of Shimane Prefecture, however similar stories are found along the Sanriku Coast and other coastal regions around Japan. These stories resemble those of other coastal yōkai which haunt fishing villages, such as iso onna. The Yamato honzō‘s umi nyōbō most likely refers to a ningyo, or mermaid, instead of this yōkai.\n\nUmi nyōbō  are often thought to be the reincarnated spirits of women who drowned in the sea. They are also sometimes said to be the wives of umi bōzu.\n\nLegends: In Iwate Prefecture, two fishermen went out to sea and did not return. Their wives waited and waited for them, and began to worry. An umi nyōbō came upon the bodies of the two drowned fishermen in the sea. She disguised herself as a human and visited the fishermen’s wives. She handed them a package and left. When the wives opened the packages, inside were the severed heads of their drowned husbands. The women screamed in horror, and were so overcome with grief that they threw themselves into the sea and drowned. It is said that afterwards they became umi nyōbō themselves.\n\nThe best known umi nyōbō story comes from the village of Uppurui in Shimane Prefecture. An old man was asked by a friend to house sit while he was away. The old man had done this many times, and was used to it. However, while half-dozing, the man suddenly felt the strange sensation that he was being watched. He awoke and looked towards the window, where for a brief moment he caught a glimpse of a pair of strange and unsettling eyes watching him. The eyes quickly vanished into the night after that. The old man felt suddenly overcome with fear. He hid himself in the closet and held his breath.\n\nA moment later, the old man heard somebody enter the house. He slid the closet door open a crack and peeked into the room. He saw a woman with long hair—only, her body was covered in scales, and she had webbed hands and feet! He realized that the creature who had been watching him was an umi nyōbō.\n\nThe umi nyōbō was carrying a red-faced newborn human baby in one arm. The old man watched as she entered the kitchen and began to snoop around. She approached a barrel of pickled fish which had a heavy stone placed on top of it to keep the lid sealed. While still carrying the human baby, she effortlessly lifted and tossed away the stone with one hand. She grabbed webbed handful after webbed handful of picked fish and gleefully swallowed them whole. Her sharp teeth glimmered. When she had eaten all of the fish, she bit into the human baby and quickly devoured that too.\n\nThe old man was paralyzed with fear, and could not look away.\n\nThe umi nyōbō finished up all the remaining bits of pickled fish and human baby, then began to scan the house with her fierce eyes. “Where is that old man I saw in here earlier? I really could use something to clean my palate!”\n\nThe umi nyōbō scanned the house once more, but saw no sign of the old man. Disappointed, she left the house and vanished into the night.\n\n",

She is well known for shape shifting and playing pranks on humans. Various tales of her misdeeds are scattered throughout Ōsaka, Hiroshima, and Tottori Prefectures, and most the Chūgoku region. Whether these all refer to the same individual or different kitsune all named Osan is not clear. Nowadays, women who interfere in others’ relationships, and particularly women involved in adulterous affairs, are sometimes disparagingly called megitsune (woman fox). This word is said to have originated from Osan gitsune.\n\nBehavior: Osan gitsune was an extremely stylish and influential individual, and frequently traveled back and forth between her hometown and the capital. She also had deeply jealous and vindictive personality. She was especially fond of causing lover’s quarrels and breaking up couples. Although she had a wide range of transformations, she is best known for transforming into beautiful women in order to seduce men into betraying their wives and girlfriends. She was so seductive that men young and old would visit her again and again. Some of them even saw through her disguise, yet still carried on human-fox romantic flings.\n\nInteractions: Osan gitsune is beloved by the villagers of Eba, Hiroshima, who claim her as their own despite her mischievous antics. By the time she was 80 years old, she had given birth to over 500 foxes who lived in the vicinity. During the food shortages after World War 2, the locals fed and took care of the city’s foxes, which were considered to be Osan gitsune’s descendants. Today, she is memorialized in Eba with a bronze statue. Her spirit is enshrined in a small shrine at Marukoyama Fudōin.\n\nLegends: In Hiroshima, Osan gitsune is said to have lived near Eba. She liked to disguise herself as a lion and set fire to her tail, then terrorize people traveling on the roads at night. One time she was captured by a merchant, who threatened to burn her alive. She begged for forgiveness, and promised him that if he would let her go, the following night she would transform into a daimyō’s procession—a rare sight indeed! The merchant agreed and released her. Sure enough, the following night, a splendid daimyō’s procession approached the city. The merchant was thoroughly impressed by the splendor and approached the procession to praise the kitsune. However, this happened to be a real daimyō’s procession. The daimyō was offended by the merchant’s impudence and had him beheaded.\n\nIn Tottori, Osan gitsune is said to have lived in a place called Garagara near present-day Tottori City. She frequently appeared to travelers, day and night, and lured them back to her home. One day she attempted to seduce a farmer named Yosobei. Yosobei was aware that a kitsune lived in the area, and he was prepared to resist her temptations. When Osan gitsune approached him, he pretended to be seduced and followed her back to her house. There, he burned her with fire. Her disguised faltered, and her true form was revealed. Osan gitsune begged for her life. Yosobei agreed to release her if she swore never to do harm again. She agreed, and she fled the area. Several years later, a man fon pilgrimage to Iga encountered a beautiful young woman traveling alone on the roads. She approached him and asked if Yosobei was still living. The man told her that yes, Yosobei was still alive. The young woman explain, “Oh god! How terrifying!” and fled into the woods.\n\n",

Apart from their incredible size, they closely resemble ordinary snakes. They make their homes in the wilderness, far from civilization.\n\nBehavior: Uwabami’s most notable feature is their appetite. They are capable of eating things that are much larger than their bodies, and in quantities that seem like more than they should be able to eat. They are also extremely fond of drinking, and can consume huge quantities of sake. Like many animals, snakes are believed to have a variety of magical powers. They can shape-shift into various objects and creatures, including humans. They can even control the elements to some extent. Natural disasters such as floods and rock slides are often attributed to uwabami.\n\nInteractions: In addition to eating large volumes of food and alcohol, uwabami also like to feed on people. They set up ambushes and assault travelers in mountain passes. Because of their size, they can easily swallow a full grown human whole—and they often do. However, they are sometimes outsmarted by clever people, who live to tell others of what they saw.\n\nOrigin: Snakes have been a part of Japanese mythology since the earliest times, in part to their peculiar behaviors. Snakes are symbols of life and death, and eternal youth—the shedding and regrowing of their skin was viewed as a magical ability. Because they can slip into the tiniest cracks, and can penetrate deep, dark places that are inaccessible to humans, they are viewed as tenacious and clever creatures. Because of these traits, snakes have long been considered to be kami or yōkai. During different periods of history, they have been referred to as orochi, daija, and uwabami, but all of these refer to the same creature.\n\nThe name uwabami has roots going back to archaic Japanese. The first part of the name, uwa, meant skillful or superior. Gradually this shifted to a similar sounding word, uha, which meant great or large. The second part of the name is from an archaic word for snake, hami. This word derives from the word for eating, hamu, which refers both to the snake’s fondness for biting and its ability to eat things that appear much larger than it. So uwabami were “skillful eaters” which over time became “giant snakes.”\n\nAnother linguistic point of interest is that the word “uwabami” also has the colloquial meaning of “heavy drinker.” The reason for this is the uwabami’s great love for sake and its ability to drink in far alcohol more than even a creature as large as it should be able to.\n\nLegends:  A famous tale comes from Ōnuma Lake in Nagano Prefecture.\n\nLong ago, there was an daija who lived in Ōnuma Lake. Every year he would transform into an extremely handsome young man and travel to the eastern mountains to view the cherry blossoms. One spring, he spied a beautiful young woman all by herself under the blossoms. The woman was Kuro hime, the daughter of Takanashi Masamori, a powerful lord of Shinano Province. Kuro hime also spied the handsome man who was watching her and found him irresistable. The two became acquainted and soon fell in love.\n\nSome time later, the handsome young man paid a visit to the castle of Takanashi Masamori. He introduced himself as the great snake who lives in Ōnuma Lake, guardian deity of the Shiga Highlands. He explained that he and Kuro hime were in love, and asked the lord for her hand in marriage. Masamori immediately snapped that he would never give his daughter to someone that was not human.\n\nThe young man did not give up, and returned day after day to ask for Kuro hime’s hand in marriage. Finally, the lord relented and gave his conditions: “If you can keep up with me on horseback and complete seven laps around my castle, I will give you my daughter.” The young man eagerly accepted and agreed to return to the castle in a few days for the race.\n\nMasamori was not about to let his daughter marry a snake. He devised a plan to kill the creature so it would leave him and his daughter alone forever. He had his servants plant swords in the grass all around the castle. Masamori was an expert rider and knew where the swords were hidden, so he would easily be able to avoid the traps.\n\nWhen the day of the race came, the young man showed up at the castle as promised. The race began, and Takanashi Masamori spurred his horse into action. He was indeed an expert rider, and the young man could not keep up with the lord. He had to transform back into a snake in order to keep pace with the horse. The swords planted around the castle perimeter pierced and tore the snakes body, but he did not give up. Finally, the lord and the snake completed their seven laps. The snake’s body was ragged, and rivers of blood flowed from his body. Immediately upon finishing his final lap, the daija collapsed. Masamori’s trap had worked.\n\nAfter some time had passed, the daija awoke. It looked around, and seeing nobody it realized that Masamori had lied. Trembling with rage, the daija returned to the Shiga Highlands. It summoned all of its family, servants, and clan members. All of the spirits of the Shiga Highlands arose and summoned a great storm. Rain the likes of which had never been seen before fell. Ōnuma Lake swelled in size and burst forth, flooding everything around. All of the villages surrounding the lake were annihalated. Houses were knocked down. Fields were flooded and washed away. No humans or animals were able to escape destruction. However, the mountains around the Takanashi Masamori’s castle acted like a shield, and the castle stood firm.\n\nKuro hime looked down from the castle and watched the torrent wash away wash away the entire region. She heartbroken when she saw the destruction. Realizing that only she had the power to stop the disaster, she left the castle by herself and traveled down to Ōnuma Lake. Kuro hime threw herself into the flood and was never seen again. When the daija realized what had happened, it immediately scattered the storm clouds and caused the flood to recede. Ōnuma Lake shrank back to its original borders.\n\nThe daija is still worshiped today as the guardian deity of the Shiga Highlands. There is a small shrine called Daija Jinja located near Ōnuma Lake where the snake is enshrined. Every August, the villagers gather there to perform the Daija Matsuri and remember the story of Kuro hime.\n\n",

            "content": "鉄鼠\nてっそTranslation: iron rat\n\nLegends: Long ago, during the reign of Emperor Shirakawa (1073-1087 CE), there lived a monk named Raigō. Raigō was the abbot of Mii-dera, a monastery in Shiga prefecture at the foot of Mount Hiei, and well known for his piety.\n\nThe Emperor, having no heir, was concerned about his line of succession. One day, he approached Raigō and asked him to pray to the gods and Buddha in his place for an heir. Raigō prayed long and hard, and finally in 1074 a royal son, Prince Taruhito, was born. The grateful Emperor promised to give the abbot anything he wished in return for his prayers. Raigō asked that a splendid new ordination building be constructed at Mii-dera so he could train new priests. The Emperor gladly agreed, however Mii-dera had a powerful rival temple — Enryaku-ji, on top of Mt. Hiei — which wielded great political power as well as having a powerful army of warrior monks at its disposal. Enryaku-ji could not abide such a gift being granted to a rival temple, and so it exerted its great pressure on the Emperor. Bowing to Enryaku-ji, the Emperor reneged on his promise to Raigō.\n\nRaigō began a hunger strike in protest of the Emperor’s broken promise, but the Emperor would not, or could not, go against Enryaku-ji’s will. On the 100th day of his hunger strike, Raigō passed away, his heart full of rage towards the unfaithful Emperor and the rival monastery of Enryaku-ji. So great was the hatred in Raigō’s heart when he died that he transformed into an onryō, a ghost driven by pure vengeance. Shortly after Raigō’s death, a ghostly vision of the abbot was seen hovering near young Prince Taruhito’s bed. A few days later the young prince died, leaving the Emperor heir-less once again. But Raigo’s vengeance did not end there.\n\nRaigō’s twisted spirit transformed into a gigantic rat. Its body was as hard as stone and its teeth and claws as strong as iron. The monstrous spirit, Tesso as it came to be called, summoned a massive army of rats which poured through Kyoto, up Mt. Hiei, and arrived at Enryaku-ji. There, the rat wreaked Raigō’s vengeance upon the monks. The army of rats poured through the monastery complex, chewing through the walls and doors, tearing up the roofs and floors, and attacking the monks. They devoured Enryaku-ji’s precious sutras, scrolls, and books, eating and despoiling everything they found — they even ate the precious statues of the Buddha.\n\nNothing could stop Tesso and the army of rats until finally a shrine was built at Mii-dera to appease Raigō’s spirit, and Raigō’s shrine still stands at Mii-dera today. An interesting footnote to the story: while Buddhist buildings are typically built facing the east, Raigo’s shrine is built facing the north. It points to the top of Mt. Hiei, directy at Enryaku-ji, the target of his rage.\n\n",

They have long arms and legs. Their bodies are covered in dark hair as if wearing an animal’s pelt. Flames lick the sides of the kettle which either serves as their head, or which they wear like a helmet.\n\nBehavior: Little is known about the true nature of narigama, however a number of theories exist. They are often depicted cavorting with other tsukumogami in illustrations of the night parade of one hundred demons.\n\nInteractions: A narigama’s most amazing talent is the ability to predict the future. As its name suggest, it begins to emit sounds when it is heated over a fire. When the water inside begins to boil, a narigama will begin to ring or cry like an animal. Depending on the sound that it emits, it is possible to know whether the weather will be rainy or fair. An onmyōji or a priest can even divine good and bad fortunes based on the sounds the narigama makes as its contents are boiled.\n\nOrigin: Illustrations of narigama appear in some of the oldest hyakki yagyō emaki picture scrolls, although they appear without a name or description. Later, Toriyama Sekien included it in Hyakki tsurezure bukuro along with a brief history. According to Sekien, the narigama was first described in the Hakutaku zu, a record of all the supernatural creatures in the world describing their strengths and weaknesses. The entry in the Hakutaku zu explains that the narigama’s ability to to “ring” is connected to an ancient oni named Renjo.\n\nThe Edo Period book Kansō kidan also describes Renjo as haunting kettles. According to this book, when a narigama begins acting up if you stand three shaku (about nintey centimeters) away from it and loudly say the name “Renjo,” the fires will descend into the earth, beneath the house. The haunting will end, and from then on the household will be blessed with good fortune.\n\nAt the Kibitsu Shrine in Okayama Prefecture, priests still practice a folk ritual called narukama which involves boiling a kettle and examining the sounds it emits to predict good and bad fortunes. According to the Okayama tradition, the ritual’s powers derive not from Renjo, but from an ancient oni named Ura who long ago terrorized the region. Eventually Ura was slain, but even in death his head cried out nonstop. The flesh was eaten away to the bone by dogs, and still cries emitted from his empty skull. Ura’s head was buried beneath the shrine’s kitchen in order to silence it, but he could still be heard groaning beneath the kettles. Finally, a priestess named Aso hime offered a sacrifice of food to Ura’s restless spirit. This quieted him, and he changed his ways. Since then, Ura’s spirit has used the crying kettle to foretell good and bad fortunes to the Kibitsu Shrine priests.\n\nToriyama Sekien may have based his description on the narukama ritual, altering the history and connecting it to ancient China in order to make it seem more authentic.\n\n",

Most often they are those who fell to vices forbidden to priests, such as attachment to women or money. No longer welcome in towns and cities, they flee to abandoned temple ruins located out in depressed rural areas and transform into yokai.\n\nLegends: In Saitama there is a place called Nodera. Long ago, a prankster decided to steal the large bronze bell from the town’s temple. However, he was spotted in the act by one of the local townspeople and fled, dropping the bell into a pond, where it got stuck. The pond became known as Kanegaike (“Bell Pond”). Some time later a lazy monk-boy was given a job by the high priest of the temple, but instead of doing what he was bid he spent the day playing with other neighborhood children. When it came time for him to face the high priest, he was so ashamed that he became depressed and threw himself into Kanegaike and drowned. After that, every night the villagers could hear the sound of crying echoing off of the great bronze bell, coming from deep within Kanegaike pond.

It is said that the kama itachi strikes with such precision that it can carve out entire chunks of flesh from its victims without spilling even a drop of blood. The attack and the healing happen so fast that the victim cannot perceive them; from his perspective he merely trips and gets up with a bit of pain and a few scratches here and there.\n\nOrigin: One theory about the kama itachi’s origin is that it is only a joke: a play on words based on a sword fighting stance known as kamae tachi.

They live in the undersea palace of Ryūgū, and like their father, their true form is that of an enormous dragon called a wani. However, they are usually depicted in art in human form, wearing the garb of ancient Japanese princesses.\n\nOrigin: Toyotama hime and Tamayori hime appear in both Kojiki and Nihon shoki, Japan’s oldest written mythologies. They are important figures in Shintō, being the grandmother and the mother of the Japanese imperial line.\n\nToyotama hime’s name literally means “luxuriant pearl princess,” but it also implies a priestess who is filled with an abundance of divine spirits. Tamayori hime’s name also refers to holy women who are possessed by powerful divine spirits—illustrating these sisters’ importance in Shintō mythology.\n\nDue to the many similarities between the story of Toyotama hime and Otohime from the Urashima Tarō legend, Otohime is often thought to be modeled after Toyotama hime.\n\nLegends: One day a hunter named Hoori from the surface world visited Ryūgū. He came to ask the sea god for permission to search the grounds of Ryūgū for the fish hook that he had borrowed from his older brother Hoderi and then lost. By a well in the gardens of Ryūgū, Hoori encountered Toyotama hime. They found each other to be very beautiful, and were soon married.\n\nHoori lived with Toyotama hime in Ryūgū for three years, but then remembered his quest to find the missing hook and he grew depressed. Tamayori hime told her father the sea god, who asked Hoori what was wrong. Hoori explained his problem. The sea god summoned all of the fish in the ocean and asked if any of them had seen the hook. A tai complained of a pain in its throat that was preventing it from eating. Upon inspection, a hook was discovered lodged in its throat. It was the hook that Hoori was searching for. The sea god returned the hook to Hoori. He also promised Hoori that he would send rain upon his fields and make him rich, while denying rain to his older brother’s fields. He lent the tide-controlling jewels manju and kanju to Hoori to defend himself against Hoderi’s attacks. Then he set Hoori on the back of an enormous dragon for his return trip to the surface world.\n\nSure enough, the sea god’s interventions caused Hoderi’s harvests to grow poor and poorer while Hoori’s grew richer and richer, spurring Hoderi to attack Hoori. Using the power of the tide-controlling jewels, Hoori raised the tide and drowned his older brother, forcing him into submission. Only when Hoderi promised to serve Hoori for the rest of time did Hoori lower the tide again.\n\nDuring this time Toyotama hime became pregnant with Hoori’s child. When her delivery grew near, she and her sister Tamayori hime came to the surface world on the back of a giant turtle to give birth. She asked Hoori to build her a birthing hut thatched with cormorant feathers along the shore, but she went into labor before he was able to complete it. Toyotama hime entered the hut. She informed Hoori that to give birth she must return to her natural form, and she asked him not to look upon her while giving birth. But Hoori could not resist. He peeked in on her and saw his wife in the form of an enormous wani, eight leagues long, creeping and writhing about on her belly.\n\nToyotama hime was ashamed at having her true form revealed. Although she desired to remain on the land, she returned to Ryūgū, leaving her newborn child behind. When she left, she closed the path that linked the land and sea kingdoms, forever separating them. Toyotama hime felt angry and betrayed, but she still loved Hoori. So she asked Tamayori hime to care for the child in her place. Tamayori hime nursed and raised her nephew, who came to be known as Ugayafukiaezu. When he grew up, he married Tamayori hime. They had four children together, one of whom became the legendary Emperor Jimmu, first emperor of Japan.\n\n",

In most cases, how they appear depends on the circumstances on their death. They retain the features and the clothing they wore when they died or were buried, which means they are dressed in white burial kimonos or the uniforms of fallen warriors. Occasionally, they have bloody wounds indicative of the way they died. Their hair is usually long and disheveled, often obstructing their face and adding to their disturbing appearance. Their hands hang limply from their wrists. Yūrei are translucent and only faintly visible. In most cases they are so faint that they appear to have no feet.\n\nInteractions: Yūrei are capable of invoking powerful curses. They do not roam about, but haunt one particular place or person. In the case of a place it is often where they died or are buried. In the case of a person it is often their killer—or sometimes their loved ones. They remain stuck in this world until they can be put to rest. This might require bringing their killers to justice, or finding their lost body, or something as simple as passing on a message to a loved one. Some yūrei are reluctant to accept their own deaths and haunt their living family, bringing misfortune and unhappiness for the rest of their family members’ lives.\n\nEach haunting is as unique as the person it originated from. Only when its purpose for existing is fulfilled—or it is exorcised by a priest—can a yūrei finally rest. But the possibility that salvation exists is a glimmer of hope for those who are affected by a haunting.\n\nOrigin: According to traditional Japanese beliefs, when a person dies his soul lives on as a separate entity, passing on to a heavenly afterlife. This transition is accomplished through a number of funeral and post-funeral rites and prayers performed by their loved ones over many years. Through these rites, the soul is reunited with its ancestors and becomes a family guardian spirit. These ancestors are enshrined in the house and continue to be honored as members of the family, particularly during the summer holiday of Obon when they are said to return to the material world to be with their families.\n\nThose who do not receive the proper funeral rites cannot pass on. They remain stuck in a purgatory that is part physical world and part ethereal. Others who die suddenly, tragically, or violently—or with grudge and malice in their hearts—are sometimes unable to pass on even with the proper prayers and rites. These lost souls transform into yūrei.\n\n",

They have bright red skin and wear priest’s robes. They are usually depicted as having a single eye which glows like lightning, however two-eyed versions also exist. Their mouth stretches from ear to ear in a terrifying grin, and when they gnash their fangs it sounds like thunder. Their hair resembles long needles. They can grow up to 1.8 meters tall, and their heads are quite large in proportion to their bodies.\n\nBehavior: Shunobon are masters of psychological horror. Their primary activity appears to be scaring humans by revealing their horrifying face at just the right time to their unsuspecting victims. People who encounter a shunobon usually end up fainting or even dying from fright.\n\nInteractions: Shunobon often work alone, but they also occasionally cooperate with other yōkai. In some stories they work with shitanaga uba and help them capture humans to eat. Shunobon are also portrayed as serving powerful yōkai like Kame hime of Inawashiro Castle and nurarihyon.\n\nOrigin: The name shunobon refers to their large heads, which resemble broad round trays. Their name was originally shunoban (朱の盤), however when Mizuki Shigeru portrayed them in his work, he wrote the name as shunobon. Due to the popularity of Mizuki’s work, shunobon became the more common spelling of this yōkai’s name.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a young samurai was traveling alone on the road through Aizu. He had heard a local legends that a monster supposedly wandered the road, so when evening came and it grew dark, he began to feel afraid. Not too far ahead of him, he spotted another young samurai walking in the same direction. He quickened his pace to catch up so he would not have to walk the road alone at night.\n\nHe chatted with the other samurai about this and that, until finally he arrived on the subject of the local legend. “I’ve heard that there a creature called a shunobon who appears on this road at night. Have you heard this legend?” asked the first samurai. The other samurai turned to him and said, “Is he supposed to look something like this…?” As he spoke, his skin became red as if covered in blood. His hair grew out into spikes. His eyes began to glow like the stars. His mouth split open from ear to ear revealing a row of razor sharp fangs! The samurai was so frightened that he fainted right there in the road.\n\nSome time later, he woke up. The monster was nowhere to be seen. The samurai ran as fast as he could down the road and stopped at the first house he saw. A woman lived there, and when she saw the terror in the poor samurai’s eyes she invited him in. As his nerves settled, he found the courage to tell the woman about the horrible monster he encountered.\n\n“You poor thing. What a horrible sight to see alone on the road,” the woman consoled him. “By the way, did the monster you saw look something like this…?” As she spoke, her face transformed into the shunobon he had seen earlier.\n\nThe samurai ran screaming from the house. He ran all the way back to his own home and hid in his futon. He was too scared to leave. After one hundred days, he succumbed to his fear and died.\n\n",

These creatures are known for their revolting appearance and smell; they give off a strong odor of rotten meat. They look like large, flabby, roughly humanoid chunks of flesh about the size of child, with lumpy, undeveloped hands and feet, and vaguely indiscernible facial features.\n\nBehavior: Nuppeppō appear usually only at night, and are not known to cause any particular harm or mischief—other than being disgusting. They seem to enjoy the nauseating effect their smell has on passersby. They frequently cause chaos and havoc by running around and disgusting people, and outrunning angry villagers who would try to chase them down and kill them.\n\nInteractions: Nuppeppō are very rare yōkai. There are only a few recorded sightings, even though their grotesque form is well-known. Accounts usually describe lords sending hosts of warriors to chase the creature out of a castle or a temple, only to have it outrun the guards and escape, causing some of them to swoon and faint from its odor. Though they are passive and non-aggressive, they can move quickly and are notoriously hard to catch.\n\nAccording to the records of Edo period pharmacists, its flesh imparts incredible power on those who eat it (providing they are willing and able to keep it down), and it can also be made into a powerful medicine with excellent curative properties.\n\nOrigin: Nuppeppō’s origins are mysterious. They are believed to be a distant relative of nopperabō. Some scholars suggest that nuppeppō may in fact be botched transformations of inexperienced shape-shifting yōkai, such as a mujina or tanuki. The origin of their name is equally mysterious. It is thought to be derived from slang for wearing too much makeup, painted so thickly that facial features become indiscernible—just as nuppeppō’s features are barely discernible on their fleshy, fatty faces.\n\n",

A mere touch is enough to give a human a deep, unshakable chill. They feed on life force, sucking it from human’s mouths with an icy breath that freezes their victims solid.\n\nInteractions: Yuki onna spend their lives hunting humans in the snow. They stay near mountain roads and prey on the travelers coming and going, or break into homes and flash-freeze the inhabitants during the night. While they are killers, Yuki onna are not entirely cold blooded. Legends say they can fall in love with their intended prey and let them go free. Some go so far as to marry humans and live happily together. As supernatural spirits never age, however, their husbands inevitably discover their true identities. This revelation usually ends these happy marriages.\n\nLegends: In Niigata Prefecture, an elderly man operated an inn on a mountain trail with his wife. One snowy night, the inn was visited by a young lady traveling alone. She warmed herself by the fire and ate with the innkeeper and his wife. She was sweet and charming and extremely beautiful. So it was even more of a surprise when, in the middle of the night during a fierce blizzard, she stood up and made to leave the inn. The innkeeper begged her not to go outside, and took her hand to hold her back. It was as cold as ice. Merely touching it sucked all the warmth from the innkeeper’s body. As he tried to keep the girl in the house, her entire body turned into a fine icy mist, and shot up the chimney and out into the night.\n\nA man from Yamagata Prefecture claimed that he had been married to a yuki onna. His wife was beautiful, with piercing eyes and skin as white as a marble statue. While he loved to take long hot baths every night, his wife always refused to bathe. This puzzled him greatly. One particularly cold and snowy night, he insisted that his wife take a bath. Otherwise she would freeze to death in the cold, he said. She protested, but there was no reasoning with the man. Finally she acquiesced. When he went in to check on her a few minutes later, all he found in the tub were half-melted icicles.\n\n",

Very little is known about them. A hōsōgyo was reportedly discovered in June of 1838 on the beach of Uraga, Sagami Province. It was captured alive and quickly became a popular misemono sideshow attraction.\n\nOrigin: When the name hōsōgyo was first written down, the kanji for the second part of its name (sō) was written with an invented character which combined the words for red (赤) and appearance (相). Although it’s hard to say what the original author had in mind, it’s possible that the fish’s strange appearance reminded people of the hōō. Or perhaps the name was chosen to make it more appealing as a sideshow attraction.\n\nThe only place this unique character appears is in hōsōgyo’s name. It is not a part of Unicode.

They appear from out of the darkness and begin to flirt. They ask their prey to lend them their lantern. When they get close enough, they snuff out the light. Then, in the pitch dark, they bite into their victims and suck the meat from their bodies, leaving nothing but skin and bones.\n\nOccasionally nikusui will approach lone men in their bedrooms. They use sex to seduce and weaken their prey. Then they can suck the meat from their prey at their leisure.\n\nInteractions: To protect against nikusui, villagers who live near the border between Mie and Wakayama Prefectures avoid walking at night without a spare light source. Those who absolutely must travel through the mountains night protect themselves by preparing spare lanterns and burning coals. If a nikusui steals their lantern, they can throw burning coals at them to keep them away.\n\nOrigin: Tales about nikusui are cautionary tales, warning young men to keep away from strange women. A beautiful woman could “snuff out a man’s fire,” draining his money and distracting him from more important things. Less metaphorically, there was a real folk belief in a sickness called jinkyo—weakness in men caused by the loss of semen. Overindulgence in sexual activity was believed to drain a man of his virility, leaving him weak and anxious. Losing too much semen could even be lethal. Therefore, sexual promiscuity was frowned upon not only due to social mores, but for health reasons too. Nikusui represent the dangers of young men overindulging in their lust.\n\nLegends: A hunter named Genzō was hunting late at night on Mt. Hatenashi. All of a sudden, a beautiful young woman of about 18 or 19 years appeared before him and laughed with an eerie “ho ho.” Though it was night, she carried no lantern. The young woman asked to borrow Genzō light. Genzō had a very bad feeling about her. He carried a blessed bullet with a prayer to Amida Buddha incribed upon. He loaded that bullet into his rifle and threatened the girl. She fled into the darkness, Genzō continued on his way.\n\nA short time later, a terrible monster over 6 meters tall rushed out of the darkness at him. Genzō fired his rifle with the holy bullet at the monster. The monster fell, and Genzō was able to get a closer look at the monster’s true form: a bleached white skeleton inside a loose bag of skin, with no meat at all.\n\n",

It occurs at night when wolves are active and hunting. Most folktales involving senbiki no ōkami fit a specific pattern. Usually, a traveler is chased by wolves on the road at night, and the only escape available is to climb high up into a nearby tree. However, the wolves start to climb on to each other’s backs, forming a living ladder. In this way, they are able to reach even the highest branches of the trees. However, the wolf ladder is one wolf too short to reach the traveler. The wolves call for their leader to complete the ladder and catch their prey. The leader of the wolves is a particularly large and canny bakemono, who climbs the ladder to face the traveler. However, the traveler is able to fend off the leader of the wolves with a sword. The following day, the wolves’ leader is traced back to the house of a person who is now lying in bed with an injury received the previous night; it is revealed that the person was actually the bakemono in disguise, responsible for the senbiki no ōkami and the deaths of many people.\n\nOrigin: This phenomenon appears in many stories about wolves, and is found in legends all across Japan. There are many variations, but they tend to follow a pattern very similar to the one described above. Folklorists consider it to be a very old tale which symbolizes wolves’ natural tendency to cooperate in large groups, their intelligence, and their athletic abilities.\n\nLegends: One famous example of this phenomenon comes from Kōchi Prefecture.\n\nA pregnant woman was traveling to Nahari and had to cross a mountain pass during the night. As misfortune would have it, deep in the mountains she fell ill with labor pains. To make matters worse, a pack of wolves was nearby. Just then, a courier showed up. He helped the woman climb safely into a tree, out of reach of the pack of wolves. He, too, climbed high up into the branches to guard the woman until morning.\n\nThe wolves gathered around the base of the tree. They leaped high into the air, but they could not reach the courier or the woman. The wolves clawed at the bark, but they could not climb the tree.\n\nThen, a strange thing happened: the wolves began to climb on to each other’s shoulders and make a living ladder. One by one the stack of wolves grew higher and higher. It almost reached the spot where the courier and the woman were clinging for their lives. The courier drew his wakizashi and slashed at the wolves, but he could not reach them, just as they could not reach him.\n\nThen, one of the wolves spoke: “Summon the blacksmith’s wife from Sakihama!” The other wolves bayed and howled. After some time, another figure appeared. It was a wolf of enormous size, wearing an iron kettle as a helmet. The great white wolf climbed up the living ladder towards the courier and the woman. When it was within striking distance, the courier struck his wakizashi downwards with all of his might. There was a loud crack as his blade split the kettle. At the same time, a human-like howl erupted from the giant wolf. A moment later, all of the wolves vanished.\n\nWhen morning came and human travelers appeared on the road, the courier helped the woman down from the tree and asked a passerby to escort her to Nahari. Then the courier searched the ground where the wolves had been. He discovered a trail of blood.\n\nThe courier followed the trail of blood all the way to Sakihama, to the door of the blacksmith’s house. The courier knocked on the door and asked the blacksmith if his wife was home. The blacksmith replied that she had suffered a head injury and was sleeping. The courier entered the house. He went into the bedroom, found the sleeping wife, and cut her to pieces with his sword. Where the woman’s form had been now lay the corpse of a great, white-furred wolf. Underneath the floorboards of the house, the courier found countless human skeletons scattered about, including the bones of the blacksmith’s real wife.\n\nToday in Sakihama, a memorial tower dedicated to the blacksmith’s wife still stands. And they say that the descendants of the blacksmith all have strangely spiked hair, like that of a wolf.\n\n",

Specifically, they are children in the service of the nobility and high ranking members of underwater society, such as guardians of lakes, rivers, ponds, and so on.

They are talented, magical children who are able to fulfill almost any wish their adoptive parents might desire. They are excellent cooks, and their meals taste better than anything known to humans. Homes with Ryūgū warashi never run out of food or money, and quickly become prosperous and wealthy. However, the ugliness of these children eventually becomes more than their people can stand. Inevitably, Ryūgū warashi are forced to bathe or are kicked out by their human parents—after which they return to the sea, and the family loses all of the wealth the Ryūgū warashi brought with it.\n\nOrigin: Tales about Ryūgū warashi are found across Japan, especially in the Tōhoku region. There are many different versions with details changing from tale to tale. However, the central theme remains the same: those who lose their gratitude after becoming wealthy end up losing everything. Ryūgū warashi share strong parallels with other child-like yōkai like zashiki warashi and hanatare kozō who bring prosperity to a family for as long as they are made to feel welcome.\n\nLegends: An impoverished elderly couple lived in a hovel the mountains. Every winter the old man chopped bamboo to make into kadomatsu—New Year’s decorations—to sell door to door. It was hard, but they managed to eke out a living. One year the old man was left with a single kadomatsu that he could not sell. Since it would be useless after New Year’s, he discarded it in a river, calling it a present for Ryūgū. As he started home, a voice called out from the river: “Ryūgū thanks you for your gift. Please, come feast with us.”\n\nThe old man was taken to a splendid feast at the dragon palace. He was given a tour through the palace and shown its magical gardens of the seasons. He was presented with as much delicious food as he could eat. But he thought of his wife waiting for him at home, and he asked to be returned to the surface world. The servants of Ryūgū took him back, and since the old couple had no children, they said they would give him a child as thanks for the gift.\n\nWhen the old man returned home, his wife was waiting for him with a little boy. “Look how amazing this child is!” the old woman sad. “Anything you wish for, he will give it to you!” She asked the boy for food, and in an instant their kitchen stores overflowed with rice. The old man asked for money, and his coin purse was suddenly filled with gold coins. It was like a miracle. All they could ever want was theirs. They wished for land, a large house, expensive clothes, and all of the comforts the wealthy enjoy.\n\nFor a while the three of them were a happy family. The old couple grew accustomed to living in their fancy house, wearing fabulous clothing, and eating the best foods. Eventually, they began to notice things that hadn’t bothered them when they were poor. For instance, they noticed how ugly the little child from Ryūgū was. And they noticed how filthy he was. The child did not fit in with their beautiful and clean, new lifestyle.\n\nWhile couldn’t do anything about the child’s face, they tried to dress him in nicer clothes. He refused to wear them. “At the very least, you must take a bath!” the old couple insisted. But no matter how hard they pressed, the child refused to bathe too. Finally they lost their tempers. They said, “If you won’t even take a bath, you should just go back to Ryūgū!”\n\nJust as they wished, the boy vanished like a wisp of smoke. And when he did, the enormous house, the gold, the fine clothes, and all of the luxuries the child had given the old couple vanished too. They were dirty, cold, and poor; just as they had been before.\n\n",

They are high ranking and holy trees, so they belong in the gardens of temples, shrines, and public places; not private gardens. Planting a ginkgo is one’s own garden was sacrilegious. In addition, they grow tall very quickly and can cause a house to become dark, which can interrupt or alter the flow of in’yō (yin and yang) energy. If the roots grow underneath the house, they could spread sickness and misfortune to a family for many generations. Residents in houses with ginkgo trees would become sick and die much sooner than those without. All manner of strange things could happen in and around houses which had ginkgo trees in their gardens.\n\n",

            "content": "小幡小平次\nこはだこへいじTranslation: none; this is his name\n\nAppearance: Kohada Koheiji is a famous ghost from Edo Period with strong connections to the theater. The real-life events that inspired his ghost story supposedly took place around the year 1700. Over the years, rumor mixed with folklore and fantasy, until his story was finally written down a hundred years later, in 1803’s Fukushū kidan Asaka no numa (“The Strange Tale of Revenge from Asaka Swamp”). His story was adapted into the kabuki play Iroeiri otogizōshi (“Colorful Fairy Tales”) shortly after that. He remained a popular figure throughout the Edo period.\n\nThe ghost of Kohada Koheiji is said to jealously guard its status as the best ghost actor. To this day, actors who perform Iroeiri otogizōshi or other adaptations of his story are haunted by strange occurrences, suspicious accidents, and even injuries.\n\nLegends: During the time when Ichikawa Danjūrō II commanded the stage there lived a third-rate actor named Kohada Koheiji. He was part of the Morita-za theater troupe and studied under master Unagi Tarōbē. Koheiji was a terrible actor. On top of that he was unattractive; he had pale, languid skin, sunken, flat eyes, and disheveled hair. He was unable to land even the smallest roles in any of Edo’s kabuki productions. Koheiji’s manager felt sorry for him, and resorted to bribing and begging to find something—anything—for the struggling actor to perform. Finally, he landed a part for Koheiji with a traveling show in the countryside, where the audiences were far less demanding than they were in Edo. Because his poor appearance allowed the producers to save money on makeup, Koheiji was cast as a ghost.\n\nKoheiji believed this to be his last chance to make it as an actor, and so he did everything he could to make his role believable. He studied the faces of dead, making note of the way their muscles fell limp and eyes stared blankly. He copied their rigid, lifeless poses. He practiced speaking in a haunting voice, and walking with an eerie gracefulness. His hard work paid off. His acting was widely acclaimed. He was suddenly the talk of the countryside. The other actors in his troupe admitted finally that Koheiji was good at one thing: being a ghost.\n\nKoheiji’s was married to a woman named Otsuka. Otsukda had been the widow of the disgraced Ikushima Hanroku, an actor who was executed for stabbing and killing the great Ichikawa Danjūrō I publicly on stage. Koheiji loved Otsuka deeply, but she was embarrassed by her husband and thought him a fool. She fell out of love with Koheiji, and into the arms of another performer in the Morita-za: a taiko player named Adachi Sakurō. While Koheiji was away acting in the countryside, Sakurō lived in Koheiji’s house in Edo with Otsuka, pretending to be the master of the house. Eventually, Otsuka asked Sakurō to get rid of Koheiji so that they could be together forever.\n\nAt the time, Koheiji was performing in rural Asaka (in present-day Fukushima Prefecture). Sakurō’s brother, a bandit named Unpei, lived nearby, and Sakurō would acquire his help in getting rid of Koheiji. Sakurō traveled to Asaka. Koheiji was surprised and delighted that his troupemate had come to join his performance. Sakurō played the drums while Koheiji played a ghost, and the audience was highly entertained. Among them was the local magistrate, who awarded Koheiji a sum of five golden ryō (a very gracious sum) for his performance. Between shows, Sakurō and Unpei planned the murder.\n\nOne day, the performance was canceled due to rain. Sakurō invited Koheiji out to the swamp to go fishing. Once they were far away from any observers, Sakurō struck Koheiji with his fishing rod and knocked him off the boat and into the swamp. Then he thrust his head down into the water and held him there until Koheiji drowned. His body sank to the bottom of the swamp.\n\nSakurō fled the swamp and went to Unpei’s secret hideout. Unpei was there, and he told Sakurō that his “guest” had already arrived. He took Sakurō into the next room, where Koheiji’s waterlogged body lay on the floor. Sakurō was shocked. “How did that get here?” he asked. Unpei said that it was already there when he arrived. Sakurō opened up Koheiji’s sleeve and took out the five golden ryō which had been paid to Koheiji. “Hah! Now his money and his wife are mine!”\n\nSuddenly, Koheiji’s body rattled and rolled over. With hands as cold as ice and strong as iron, he grabbed Sakurō’s wrist. Sakurō screamed and tried to get free, but the corpse was locked onto his arm. He tugged and yanked his wrist harder and harder until the corpse flopped on top of his own body. Koheiji’s eyes popped open, and he locked his gaze upon Sakurō.\n\nSakurō screamed. Unpei heard this and rushed into the room. The corpse was lying on top of his brother, eyes locked in a vengeful stare. Sakurō was paralyzed with fear. Unpei tried to pull the corpse off of his brother, but it wouldn’t budge. Unpei drew his sword. He lopped off Koheiji’s head in a single stroke. The head rolled across the room, but the rest of him still gripped Sakurō’s wrist tightly. Finally, Unpei cut each of the hand’s fingers off individually. Sakurō was freed. Without a moment’s delay Sakurō fled out the door. He didn’t stop until he reached Edo.\n\nWhen Sakurō arrived at to the Kohada residence, he called out for Otsuka. In a panic he rapidly told her everything that happened: the murder, the ghost, the icy cold grip of the corpse and its hateful eyes. Otsuka was confused. “Koheiji just got home a little while ago. He was tired, so he’s resting in the back room.” Sakurō couldn’t believe it. He took Otsuka’s hand and timidly crept into the house, towards the room where Koheiji was sleeping.\n\nWhen Sakurō entered the bedroom, he saw someone sleeping behind a folding screen. He tried to pull the screen away, but a pale, blue-tinged hand grabbed the end of it and held it fast. Sakurō did not give up. He pulled as hard as he could. There was a popping sound. The folding screen crashed to the floor along with Sakurō. Five severed fingers rolled around on the floor and instantly began to rot. The sickening smell of death filled the room. But there was no body behind the folding screen. A tiny flame floated up into the air and flew out the window. Sakurō was terrified, however Otsuka was undisturbed. If anything, she seemed relieved that Koheiji was finally dead. She soon arranged for a funeral, and then for a wedding.\n\nSakurō and Otsuka lived as husband and wife. Half a year passed without any further disturbances. They forgot about Koheiji altogether. Then, one night Sakurō awoke to find another man in the bed between himself and Otsuka. He leaped to his feet in a rage, but there was no one there. From that moment, Sakurō began to doubt Otsuka’s fidelity.\n\nOne night, while returning home from drinking late at night, Sakurō saw a figure climb into his bedroom window. When he peeked in, he saw another man in bed with Otsuka. In a drunken rage, he ran into the house and drew his sword. Otsuka awoke in a panic and without thinking, she raised her hand in defense. In doing so, she grabbed the sword’s blade. All five of her fingers were severed. The fingers fell to the floor and rotted away, filling the room with the smell of death. The mysterious stranger was nowhere to be seen. A cackling laugh could be heard from above them. It was Koheiji’s voice! Otsuka lost her mind, and fell to the floor in shock.\n\nEvery night, the ghost returned to haunt them. As the haunting continued, Sakurō began to lose his mind too. In life, Kohada Koheiji the had so perfected his ghost act that it was indistinguishable from the real thing. In death, Koheiji’s performance was terrifying and sublime. Otsuka never recovered from her madness, and died soon after.\n\nOtsuka’s treatments had cost Sakurō nearly everything he owned, including the five golden ryō he had stolen from Koheiji. Sakurō gave up his few remaining coins to hold a funeral for Otsuka. However, the priest he hired was a con artist, and ran off with the last of Sakurō’s money.\n\nPenniless and insane, Sakurō was forced to live as a beggar. One day, he thought he saw the priest who had tricked him and stolen his money. Sakurō chased after him, but the priest swung his staff and beat Sakurō severely, knocking him off the road and into a pond. Then the bruised, soaked Sakurō realized that it was not the same priest after all. He crawled out of the pond and apologized, but the priest struck Sakurō over and over, beating him nearly to death. Some strangers broke up the fight.\n\nThey took Sakurō back to his house to rest, but his wounds were severe and he fell into a fevered insanity. All night his neighbors could hear him crying in delirium. He never woke up. When they found him the next day, Sakurō’s was bloated and discolored—just like that of a drowned corpse.\n\nSome time later, the great Ichikawa Danjūrō II heard of the story of the famous ghost actor Kohada Koheiji’s tragic murder. He pitied him, and offered prayers in his honor. As he prayed, the drowned ghost of Koheiji appeared behind him.\n\n“Koheiji. You were only ever good at being a ghost,” said Danjūrō.\n\nWith that final recognition, Koheiji’s ghost seemed content, and vanished.\n\n",

They have long, disheveled hair, discolored skin, and sunken eyes. They wear white burial robes and, like most Japanese ghosts, have no legs.\n\nBehavior: Kubikajiri appear on the autumn equinox. They lurk around graveyards, looking for freshly buried corpses. When they find one, they dig it up and begin eating it, leaving blood and gore all over the ground.\n\nOrigin: Kubikajiri developed from a painting by Ippitsusai Bunchō of a ghost eating a man’s head in a graveyard. At some point, the picture was copied and renamed kubikajiri, and described as a yōkai rather than a yūrei.\n\nThere are two popular explanations for the origin of this yōkai. One says that kubikajiri are created when a person dies and is buried without their head. Their corpse turns into this yōkai and begins to hunt for fresh heads in graveyards.\n\nAnother explanation says that kubikajiri are the spirits of elderly people who have starved to death. During periods of famine or economic trouble, family members who were seen as a burden—such as the very old or infirm—were occasionally neglected and allowed to die in order to reduce the number of mouths to feed. Resentment of this mistreatment turns the dead into yōkai after their deaths. After the person who allowed them to die has themselves died, the kubikajiri will dig up their grave and then devour the head.\n\n",

He wears special robes (the particular outfit varies depending on which shrine the ritual is being performed at), and carries a spear in his right hand and a shield in his left hand. The name also refers to a demon god which this priest would dress up as during yearly purification rituals. This god appears as a four-eyed oni who can see in all directions, and punishes all evil that it sees.\n\nBehavior: During the early Heian Period, the hōsōshi’s duties included leading coffins during state funeral processions, officiating at burial ceremonies, and driving corpse-stealing yōkai away from burial mounds. By donning the mask and costume, the hōsōshi (priest) became the hōsōshi (god) and was able to scare away evil spirits. The hōsōshi’s most famous duty was a purification ceremony called tsuina.\n\nTsuina was performed annually on Ōmisoka—the last day of the year—at shrines and government buildings (such as the imperial palace). In this ritual, the hōsōshi and his servant would run around the shrine courtyard (covering “the four directions”), chanting and warding the area against oni and other evil spirits. Meanwhile, a number of attending officials would shoot arrows around the hōsōshi from the shrine or palace buildings, symbolically defending the area against evil spirits. Other observers would play small hand drums with ritualistic cleansing significance.\n\nOrigin: Hōsō was a concept related to divination, the four directions, and the magical barriers between the human world and the spirit world. It dealt with creating and maintaining these boundaries and barriers. It including things like planting trees or placing stones in the four corners of an area, or utilizing existing features like rivers and roads, which serve as natural boundaries. By maintaining these natural boundaries, the spiritual boundaries between the worlds could also be maintained, with the ultimate goal of keeping the imperial family and other government officials safe from supernatural harm.\n\nThe concept originated in ancient Chinese folk religion, where it is called fangxiang. The fangxiangshi wore a four eyed mask and a bear skin, and acted as a sort of exorcist. Chinese folk religion eventually became mixed with Buddhism and Taoism, and made its way to Japan. The Japanese hōsōshi’s rituals and costume were derived from this folk belief.\n\nOver time, the Japanese version evolved further away from its Chinese roots. The hōsōshi came to be seen not as a god which keeps oni away, but as an oni itself. Rather than exorcising evil spirits, the hōsōshi became an evil spirit, and it was the imperial officials who chased away and exorcised the hōsōshi (thus symbolically chasing all evil spirits away). This may have been due to changing perceptions during the Heian period about the concept of ritual purity. The hōsōshi, who was associated with funerals and dead bodies, came to be viewed as unclean. It would be inappropriate for such a creature to be on the same “side” as the imperial household, so it became the target of the ritual instead of the officiator.\n\nWhile the governmental position of hōsōshi no longer exists today, some shrines still perform annual tsuina rituals involving the hōsōshi. The celebration of Setsubun, in which beans are thrown at people wearing oni masks, is also derived from this ancient ritual.\n\n \n\n",

They are native to the islands of Okinawa, but are common in ornamental gardens across Asia. They usually appear as a human face amongst the broad, flat banana leaves.\n\nInteractions: Bashō no sei are not particularly hostile or threatening towards people. They generally limit themselves to merely scaring humans by suddenly appearing next to them. For example, in one story a bashō no sei takes the form of a young woman, appears next to a meditating monk and asks him, “Can even inanimate plants attain buddhahood?”\n\nThey are not completely without danger, however—some local legends tell of bashō no sei assaulting and even impregnating humans. Women were warned not to walk near banana trees past 6 pm. If they did, they would run into a yōkai among the broad leaves—sometimes a monster, other times a handsome young man. Shortly after, the woman would become pregnant. When the baby was born 9 months later, it would have tusks or fangs like a demon. What’s more, the following year and again every year after that, the woman would give birth to another demon. Whenever a demon child was born, it would have to be killed by feeding it a poisonous drink made of powdered kumazasa (a type of bamboo grass); this is supposedly the reason why kumazasa is commonly found growing near houses in Okinawa.\n\nOrigin: Stories about banana tree spirits are numerous across Japanese, Chinese, and Ryūkyūan folklore. The Edo period herbalist Satō Chūryō recorded his observations about these spirits in an essay. According to him, Ryūkyū’s banana orchards were so large that they contained rows of trees many miles long. If you walked past them at night, you were guaranteed to experience something strange. He observed that the spirits that come out of the banana trees did not cause any direct harm to people other than spooking them, but nevertheless could be avoided if you carried a sword. Chūryō’s theory was that banana trees weren’t necessarily unique in having spirits, but that because their leaves are so large and they were planted in such large numbers, it is particularly easy for humans to see these trees’ spirits. He believed that was the reason for the large number of superstitions about banana trees compared with other plants.\n\nLegends: A story from Nagano tells of a priest who was sitting outside and reciting suttras when a beautiful young woman appeared and attempted to seduce him. The priest grew angry. He stabbed the woman with his sword and she ran away. The next morning, the priest found a bloody trail left by the woman he had stabbed. The trail lead to the temple’s gardens, where a bashō tree was lying on the ground, cut in two. The priest then realized that the woman was actually the spirit of the tree.\n\n",

During major epidemics, many diseased bodies were burned there. It is said that there was an unending column of smoke rising from the mountain from all the burning bodies.\n\nTowards the end of the 10th century, a number of monks decided to offer themselves up in ritual sacrifice by fire. They believed that in doing so, they would rid themselves of their worldy attachments, along with their bodies, and achieve enlightenment. The ceremony was open to the public, and a large number of people came to witness the event. However, it would seem that a number of these priests did not actually achieve enlightenment. They must not have been able to truly give up their attachments to the material world.

It and the other heavenly birds sing the holy scriptures in nirvana, and those who listen to their songs can achieve enlightenment.\n\nOrigin: Gumyōchō originate in the cosmology of Pure Land Buddhism. They were brought to Japan in the sixth century along with Buddhism. They are often used as ornamentation on Buddhist temples. Their story is a parable for the interdependence of all humans on one another.\n\nLegends: Long ago, a gumyōchō lived in the snowy mountains of India. It had two heads and one body. One head was named Karuda, and the other head was named Upakaruda. The bird’s two heads had different personalities and desires. When one head was sleepy, the other one wanted to play. When one head was hungry, the other one wanted to rest. Eventually, the two heads began to resent each other.\n\nOne day while Upakaruda was sleeping, Karuda feasted on delicious fruits and flowers until he was stuffed and could eat no more. When Upakaruda woke up, he wanted to eat too, but he was already full because they shared one stomach. He could not enjoy any of the food.\n\nUpakaruda decided to punish Karuda. While Karuda slept, Upakaruda found a tree with poisonous fruit. Because they shared one stomach, Upakaruda ate the fruit in order to make Karuda sick. Sure enough, when Karuda woke up, the poison had already taken effect. Karuda writhed and suffered, and then died. Of course, because they shared one body, Upakaruda also became sick, collapsed in agony, and then died.\n\nJust before dying, Upakaruda realized how foolish he had been. While he resented his other head, he failed to recognize that his own life depended on it. Just the same, by harming his other head, he was also harming himself. When he realized this, he realized one of the core tenets of Buddhism: interconnectedness. The birds became enlightened and were reborn in nirvana.\n\n",

They are about the size of a tanuki or a river otter, and their shapes resembles a monkey. They have red eyes, short tails, black fur with a leopard-like pattern, and blue-greenish manes which run from nose to tail.\n\nBehavior: Fūri are nocturnal, and spend the daylight hours sleeping. At night they leap from tree to tree, or cliff face to cliff face, with soaring jumps. They can moves as quickly as the wind, and resemble flying birds when they leap. They can clear the distance between two mountains in a single leap.\n\nFūri’s diet consists of spiders and the fragrant wood from incense trees, however they have also been observed hunting. They use a special kind of grass (the species is unknown) and climb to the top of a tree. They hold the grass out in their hands to try to attract a bird. When a bird comes for the grass, the fūri is able to catch and eat the bird.\n\nInteractions: Fūri are extremely fast, but Chinese records say that it possible to capture one with a well-placed net. A captured fūri will act embarrassed, lowering its head and looking up with big, pitiful eyes in an attempt to convince a person to release it. They are very fragile, and die immediately if they are struck. However, if you try to slice them up with a sword or knife, the blade will not cut through their skin. If you try to roast them with fire, their bodies will not burn. They have the amazing ability to revive from death merely if wind blows into their open mouths. However, they cannot revive if their skull has been broken, or if their nose is stuffed with leaves of Japanese rush (Acorus gramineus), a wetland shrub.\n\nOrigin: Fūri appear in various Chinese atlases of herbology and medicine. These were referenced by Japanese authors during the Edo period, causing fūri to be incorporated into Japanese folklore. The original description of the fūri is most likely based on the colugo—a gliding mammal native to Southeast Asia. There are no colugo in Japan, which is likely why Japanese folklorists described them as a subspecies of tanuki.\n\n",

The noh play Momijigari (“Hunting Momiji” or “Fall-Leaf Hunting”) first appeared hundreds of years ago, during the Muromachi period. During the Meiji period it was remade as a kabuki play. Momijigari was made into a film in 1899, becoming the first narrative film in Japan. It was designated an Important Culture Property in 2009.\n\nLegends: Long ago a powerful witch named Momiji lived in the mountains of Nagano prefecture. Her story takes place during the season of fall-leaf-viewing, when groups of people would gather in the mountains for festivals and parties under the falling red, orange, and gold leaves.\n\nDuring this time, a samurai named Taira no Koremochi was charged by a local Hachiman shrine with hunting oni. His hunt had taken him to Togakushi mountain, where a particularly nasty kijo was said to live.\n\nKoremochi and his retainers climbed the beautiful mountain, and they came upon a small group of aristocrats having a leaf-viewing party. Koremochi sent one of his retainer ahead to investigate. The retainer approached to inquire about the party, and was told that a noble princess was hosting it; however the ladies in waiting would not tell him the princess’ name. Just as Koremochi and his retainers decided to continue on their mission, one of the ladies-in-waiting approached and told them that her mistress had heard of Koremochi before, and she wanted to invite them to her party. Despite his mission Koremochi could not rudely turn down a princess, so he and his companions agreed.\n\nAt the party, the warriors were introduced to Princess Sarashina, an extremely beautiful young woman. They all sat and enjoyed watching the leaves, drinking sake, and dancing. Koremochi asked the princess if she would dance for him, and she did. Soon the men became drunk and sleepy, and dozed off under the beautiful trees.\n\nAs he slept, Koremochi dreamed of Hachiman and his mission. The god told him that Princess Sarashina was actually the kijo Momiji in disguise, and that he must kill her with the holy katana, Kogarasumaru (“Little Crow”). When Koremochi woke up, the sword he dreamed of was in his hand — a gift from Hachiman — and he knew that what he dreamed had been real. He chased after the women, and all of a sudden a huge firestorm broke out. Flame and wind lit up the mountain. Suddenly a ten foot tall kijo with horns made of burning trees appeared, and an intense battle between the samurai and the demoness took place. In the end, thanks to his magical sword, Koremochi was successful, and slew the Witch of Togakushi Mountain.\n\n",

Shukaku is best known for his miraculous tea kettle, known as the bunbuku chagama, which he left to the Morinji as a gift.\n\nOrigin: Shukaku’s story has been told by Morinji for centuries, but different versions and variations have sprung up over the years. Its popularity spread during the Edo period thanks to a booming publishing industry, and it became well known across Japan. Although Shukaku is associated with Morinji, the structure of his story—a magical animal presenting a wonderful gift to humankind—is a recurring motif throughout Japanese folklore.\n\nLegends: Morinji was founded in 1426 by a priest named Dairin Shōtsū. While he was traveling through various countries on pilgrimage, he befriended a priest named Shukaku, and they traveled together. After Morinji was built, Shukaku stayed on to act as a head priest there for many years.\n\nIn 1570, an important religious gathering was held at Morinji. Priests from all over the country traveled to Morinji. When it came time to serve tea, the priests realized that they did not have enough kettles to serve such a large gathering. Shukaku—still serving the temple 144 years after his arrival—brought his favorite tea kettle to help serve the priests.\n\nThis tea kettle was a miraculous object, for no matter how many times you dunked a ladle in it, it was always brimming with enough hot water to make tea. It also stayed hot for many days after heating it! The kettle was given the name “bunbuku chagama”—chagama being the word for tea kettle, and bunbuku meaning “to spread luck.” The name was a pun as well: the sound of boiling water is bukubuku, which sounds very much like bunbuku. Thanks to Shukaku’s marvelous tea kettle, the gathering was a great success. The bunbuku chagama continued to be used by the temple for many years. Shukaku, as well, continued to work at Morinji for many years after that.\n\nAccording to Morinji’s records, On February 28, 1587, a monk walked in on Shukaku while he was taking a nap. The monk noticed that Shukaku had a tanuki’s tail! Thus, Shukaku’s great secret was uncovered: he was not a human priest, but a tanuki in disguise. He had been living among humans for thousands of years. Long ago he had traveled through India and China. Eventually he met Dairin Shōtsū, who befriended him and brought him to Morinji, where he used his magic to serve the temple as best as he could. After his secret was uncovered, Shukaku decided it was time to leave Morinji. To apologize for the great shock he had caused Morinji, he gave them a parting gift: he used his magic to present the story of the Battle of Yashima, one of the final clashes of the Genpei War. To show their gratitude for all that he had done, the priests built a shrine to Shukaku, where he is still worshipped as a local deity. And the bunbuku chagama, which Shukaku left behind, is on display in his shrine at Morinji.\n\n",

It doesn’t have feet, but instead has a long, twisting body which allows it to leap high into the air.\n\nInteractions: An ushirogami’s favorite tactic is to scare people by leaping out and appearing right behind them (thus its name). They like to tug on the hairs on the back of a person’s neck and then vanish just as they turn around to see touched them. Other pranks that ushirogami enjoy include placing their icy cold hands or breathing their hot breath onto the necks of their victims. Ushirogami particularly like going after cowardly young women walking the streets at night. They sneak up behind them and untie their hair, causing it to fall all over the place; or they run their hands through the woman’s hair and mess it around, causing it to become tangled. Sometimes they call up strong gusts of wind to blow umbrellas away.\n\nOrigin: Ushirogami is thought to be a kind of okubyōgami—a spirit that causes cowardice, or that specifically targets cowardly people. Its name comes from the words ushiro (behind) and kami (spirit). However, there is a hidden pun in its name: ushirogami also means the hair on the back of your neck, and the phrase ushirogami wo hikikaeru (to have the hairs on the back of your neck pulled) means to do something with painful reluctance. It describes a person who has to do something that they really don’t want to do. As they search for some way out of it, they turn around and look behind them as if the hairs in the back of their head were being metaphorically pulled. The pun is that the ushirogami (spirit) is pulling on your ushirogami (hair), causing you to become cowardly and not want to do something. You turn around to see who pulled your hair, but there is no one back there. Thus the ushirogami can be explained as both an external entity which causes fear, or as the internal personification of your own cowardice or reluctance.\n\n",

It’s entire body is black, and it wears black robes. Its face has somewhat bestial features. It has a long tongue, and it reeks of rotting fish. Its hands and feet are said to be indiscernible. It can change its height rapidly, becoming a towering monster in an instant. It is extremely fast, and can run as fast as if it were flying.\n\nInteractions: Kuro bōzu haunt areas inhabited by humans. They come out at night, sneaking into houses after everyone is asleep. They creep up to their victims—primarily women—and suck the breath out of their mouths. They also slide their putrid tongues into the mouths, ears, and all over the faces of their victims. Those visited repeatedly by kuro bōzu become very ill.\n\nOrigin: Kuro bōzu didn’t appear in folklore until the Meiji period, so they are relatively new by yōkai standards. Because of the wide variations in reports, it is hard to come up with a clear picture of this yokai’s identity. Some experts believe they are a kind of nopperabō, due to their vague and indiscernible features. Some compare them to yamachichi, who also sneak into houses to steal the breath of sleeping humans. Its size-changing abilities and monk-like appearance suggest that it may be a variety of taka nyūdō. Still others say that it is one of the forms taken by magical kawauso.\n\nLegends: The most well known kuro bōzu report comes from the early Meiji period, from a newspaper article in the Hōchi Shinbun. The encounter took place at a certain carpenter’s house in Kanda, Tokyo. At midnight, a black, shadowy figure shaped like a monk suddenly appeared in the house. The creature entered the bedroom where husband and wife were sleeping. It climbed over the carpenter’s sleeping wife and stuck its tongue in her ears and mouth. Then it licked her all over. The creature smelled like foul garbage. The smell was so noxious that the family became ill.\n\nAgain and again for several nights, the kuro bōzu returned to assault the carpenter’s wife. Finally, she could not put up with it anymore. She left her husband and went to stay with some relatives. According to the carpenter, after his wife left, the black monk stopped coming.\n\n \n\n",

It vaguely resembles a Buddhist monk, but it has a long neck, sharp claws, a body covered in thick, dark hair, and a very long tongue which it uses to lap up the oil from lamps.\n\nInteractions: Himamushi nyūdō bothers people who are working hard or studying late at night by jumping out of the darkness and scaring them.  Although it doesn’t directly attack people, its presence is disturbing enough. It blows out the lights suddenly, and it licks up the precious lamp oil, making it difficult to continue working.\n\nOrigin: According to Toriyama Sekien’s description of this yōkai in Konjaku hyakki shūi, himamushi nyūdō is born from those who were lazy in life, carelessly wasting time from birth to death.\n\nThe word “oven bug” in its name is probably a reference to cockroaches. The hima kanji in this yokai’s name can also be read kama—and likely refers to the kamado, a traditional Japanese oven. Cockroaches have quite a few nicknames in Japanese; among them himushi (“fire bug”) and hitorimushi (“lamp bug”), both of which sound similar to himamushi. Cockroaches and other pests would have fed on the fish oil in Edo period oil lamps; just like this yōkai. Cockroaches live in dark, warm spaces, such as underneath a kamado; just like this yōkai. And they crawl out of the floorboards to scare those working late at night; just like this yōkai.\n\nHimamushi nyūdō’s name contains a number of puns. According to Toriyama Sekien, it was originally called himamushiyo nyūdō (“monks who waste time at night”). Over the years, the pronunciation gradually morphed, and it became associated with hemamusho nyūdō—a popular Edo period word doodle in which a monk is drawn using the characters in its name: ヘマムショ入道. The connection with this cartoon character would probably have amused readers during Sekien’s time.\n\n",

They fly through the air as a fish swims in water, and are quite shy, rarely appearing before humans.\n\nBehavior: Amikiri don’t interact with humans very much, except for one particular activity which is the reason that they are called “net cutters.” For some strange reason, amikiri love to cut nets, whether it be a fishing net, a screen door or window, or a kaya — a Japanese hanging mosquito net. While they are not directly harmful, this mischief is not entirely benign either: the life of a fisherman is tough, and a fisherman whose nets have been shredded by an amikiri could find his livelihood ruined.\n\nOrigin: It’s unclear where amikiri come from, although they bear a very strong resemblance both in name and shape to an arthropod-like yokai called kamikiri. Stories about amikiri are rare, and their name and shape may actually be a pun; the word ami means net in Japanese, but it also is the name of a type of tiny shrimp.\n\nLegends: A story from Yamagata prefecture tells of a fisherman who one day found that his fishing net had been shredded to the point of worthlessness. He suspected the work of an amikiri. The next day, he took special care to hide his nets at his home where they could not be found by any wandering yokai. That night, however, the amikiri snuck into his room while he slept and cut up the kaya covering his bed. The man woke up with his entire body covered in painful, itchy mosquito bites.\n\n",

Old legends say that a monkey which reaches a very old age will transform into a hihi.\n\nBehavior: Hihi can run very fast and primarily feed on wild animals such as boars, battering them down and snatching them up just as a bird of prey snatches up small animals. The hihi gets its name from the sound of its laugh. When it sees a human it can’t help but burst into laughter. letting out a loud, “Hihihihi!” When it laughs, its long lips curl upwards and completely cover its eyes.\n\nInteractions: While hihi primarily feed on wild beasts, they will also prey on humans if given the opportunity. They are known to catch and run off with human women in particular. If a hihi catches a human there is only one way to escape: by making it laugh. While it is laughing and blinded by its own lips, it can be taken down by striking it in the middle of the forehead with a sharp spike.\n\nHihi are sometimes confused with other monkey-like yokai that live in the mountains, such as yamawaro and satori. The hihi is much bigger, more violent, and far more dangerous than these. Some stories say that, like satori, hihi have the ability to speak human words and read human hearts and thoughts. They are valued for their blood, which is a vivid, bright red. If used as a dye, the bright red color will never fade or run. If drunk, the imbiber is said to gain the ability to see demons and spirits.\n\nOrigin: The hihi’s origins lie in ancient Chinese mythology, where it was believed to be a supernatural monkey that lived in the mountains. It was brought over to Japan by folklorists during the middle ages. In modern Japanese, hihi is the word for baboon, which takes its name from its resemblance to this yokai.\n\n",

They look like a cross between a kappa and a monkey. They also closely resemble their Okinawan cousins, kijimunā. Their bodies are covered in dark red or black hair, and they have long, thin legs and arms. They are slightly larger in size than a human child. They have pointed mouths, and on top of their heads is a saucer-like depression which holds a small amount of oil or water. Their bodies smell like yams, and their drool smells terrible.\n\nBehavior: Kenmun make their homes in banyan trees and spend their days playing in the mountains or near the water in their family groups. They particularly enjoy sumo wrestling, at which they are very skilled. As the seasons change, they migrate back and forth from the mountains to the sea.\n\nKenmun have a number of strange abilities. They are able to change their shapes. They often disguise themselves as people, horses, or cows. They can change into plants and blend in with the surrounding vegetation, or even disappear entirely. Kenmun can also create light. Their drool glows eerily, as do their fingertips. They have the ability to create fire from the tips of their fingers. Sometimes they use this fire to light the oil in their head-dishes. When mysterious lights are seen in the mountains or on the shores of the Amami islands, it is called kenmun machi by locals.\n\nKenmun like to hunt at night, lighting up their fingertips to search for food in the dark. They primarily feed on fish and small shellfish. They also enjoy slugs and snails, pulling off the shells and rolling them up like rice balls. (It is possible to identify a banyan tree inhabited by a kenmun by the sheer amount of snail shells piled up among its roots.) They absolutely hate octopus and giant clams, and will have nothing to do with them.\n\nInteractions: Kenmun stay away from inhabited areas and run away when large groups of people are nearby. They will occasionally aid lone woodcutters and people gathering firewood by carrying heavy loads for them. They remember those who treat them kindly or do them favors. A fisherman who saves a kenmun from being attacked by an octopus is sure to earn its eternal gratitude. Some elderly islanders who have befriended kenmun are to call friendly kenmun out from the mountains to show to their grandchildren.\n\nIn general, kenmun do not harm people. They do, however, love competition, and cannot resit the chance to challenge a human to a sumo match. When their head-dish is filled, they have supernatural strength and cannot be beaten. However, kenmun like to mimic people, so if a challenger stands on their head or bows very low, their head-dish will empty out and they can be beaten.\n\nWhile kenmun are not evil, they do enjoy playing pranks on humans from time to time. They may shape shift into animals and try to scare humans, or offer directions to people that get them totally and helplessly lost. They also have no shame about stealing food or even utensils from humans. Kenmun are very sensitive about being insulted, particularly about their body odors. Because of this, if a person talks about bad smells or farting while in the mountains, any kenmun who overhear it will become upset.\n\nKenmun do occasionally do wicked things to humans. There are stories of children who wandered into the woods and had their souls stolen by kenmun. Afterwards, the children behaved like kenmun, living in banyan trees and leaping from tree to tree when the villagers tried to catch them. Adults can have their souls stolen by kenmun as well. Kenmun like to force feed them snails, or pull them into rivers. These people are often later found unconscious beneath a banyan tree. If a banyan tree in which a kenmun lives is cut, the kenmun will place a curse upon the woodcutter. The kenmun’s curse causes its victims eyes to swell up, and then go blind. Eventually the cursed person will die.\n\nSome families hang pig foot bones or Japanese pittosporum branches from the eaves of their roofs in order to keep kenmun from coming close. To drive away a kenmun, all it takes is to threaten it with an octopus. Merely threatening to throw an octopus at them is enough to send them running. If an octopus is not available to throw at them, they will also run away from a giant clam, or anything else you throw at them as long as you pretend it’s an octopus.\n\n",

It was sighted at Hōryū-ji and Shitennō-ji temples, where it took the form of ghostly woodpecker and tried to destroy the temples until it was driven away by Prince Shōtoku.\n\nLegends: Long long ago, when Japan was still called Yamato and the capital was located in what is today Nara, the nobility was divided into two different types: shinbetsu, clans that claimed to be descended from the gods, and kōbetsu, clans that claimed to be descended from the imperial family. The highest ranking titles in these groups were Muraji, for the shinbetsu clans, and Omi, for the kōbetsu clans. In the 6th century CE, when Buddhism was brought to Yamato from China, it caused a great deal of rivalry between the shinbetsu and kōbetsu nobility.\n\nMononobe no Moriya was the leader of the Mononobe clan and a Muraji. The Mononobes, a shinbetsu clan, strongly supported the old Shinto religion. His rival, Soga no Umako, was an Omi, and supported the promotion of Buddhism throughout Yamato. Mononobe no Moriya and Soga no Umako held considerable power in the imperial court. During the reign of Emperor Bidatsu (572-585), Mononobe no Moriya held higher favor with the emperor, but when Emperor Yōmei took power in 585, Moriya’s favor fell and Soga no Umako’s rose, as the new emperor was a Buddhist.\n\nEmperor Yōmei died in 587, after which the Mononobe clan and Soga clan tried their best to influence the succession of the imperial title. Each of them supported a different prince to become emperor, and they fought bitterly for their clans’ interests. Finally, war broke out between the two rival clans. Mononobe no Moriya set fire to Buddhist temples and tossed the first statues of the Buddha brought to Yamato into the canals in his fight to purge the foreign religion from his homeland. Moriya and Umako mustered their armies and met on the battlefield in Kawachi. There, at the Battle of Mount Shigi, Mononobe no Moriya was killed by Soga no Umako and Prince Shōtoku, and the Mononobe clan was almost completely exterminated. Afterwards, the Soga clan rose to even higher prominence, and Prince Shōtoku, a devout Buddhist, began the construction many new Buddhist temples.\n\nThe spirit of defeated Mononobe no Moriya did not rest, though. As he lay dying in hatred and resent, Moriya transformed into an onryō. His ghost took the form of a ghostly woodpecker, which would later be seen at the temples built by Prince Shōtoku. The bird pecked furiously at the wooden buildings, determined even in death to destroy the heretical new religion. Prince Shōtoku was finally able to drive away this teratsutsuki by magically transforming into a hawk and attacking it. After that, the ghost of Mononobe no Moriya was never seen again.\n\n",

Families who own hinnagami quickly become rich and powerful; and people who become rich and famous very quickly are sometimes suspected of owning hinnagami.\n\nHinnagami come with a catch: if a new request is not made as soon as a wish is granted, the hinnagami will demand, “What is next?” As soon as that request is fulfilled, the hinnagami demands another, and another, and another. This pattern never ends. Because their creation comes out of human greed and desire, hinnagami cling to their creators obsessively and never leave their sides. A hinnagami’s attachment is so powerful, in fact, that even death cannot separate it from its master. When a hinnagami’s creator dies, the hinnagami will follow them to hell and haunt them for all of eternity.\n\nOrigin: Hinnagami are created through a long and complicated ritual. There are a few methods of creating a hinnagami, which vary bit by bit depending on who you hear the story from.\n\nIn the most common ritual, the person who wishes to create a hinnagami must begin collecting grave earth that has been trampled on by people during the day. Grave earth must be collected in this way every night for three years. For an even stronger hinnagami, they should take earth from seven different graveyeards in seven different villages. Once collected, the grave earth is mixed with human blood until it becomes clay-like. Then it is molded into a doll shape representing a god or a spirit that its creator worships. This doll is placed and left in a busy road until it has been trampled upon by one thousand people. Then the creator retrieves the doll, which has become a hinnagami.\n\nAn alternative method is to collect graveyard stones and carve them into one thousand small dolls, each about nine centimeters long. These dolls are boiled in a large pot until only one of them rises to the surface. The doll that rises is said to contain the combined souls of all one thousand dolls. It becomes a special type of hinnagami called a kochobbo.\n\n",

This play on words is the reason that this yokai grew birds’ eyes as a result of stealing copper coins. Money was also sometimes referred to as oashi, or “feet,” because it comes and goes as if it had its own feet.\n\nThe phrase ashi ga tsuku is a common idiom which means “to catch someone who has committed a crime.” Very clever readers would have noticed that if the word ashi, which can also mean money, is replaced with chōmoku, which can also mean money, the phrase changes to mean “covered in bird eyes.”\n\nLegends: Long ago, in what is now Tochigi prefecture, lived a nobleman named Fujiwara no Hidesato. He had just been granted the title of kokushi of Shimotsuke province for his valor in defeating the rebel Taira no Masakado. One day while hunting in his newly acquired countryside, Hidesato was approached by an old man, who warned him that some kind of oni had been sighted at the horse graveyard at Utsunomiya. Hidesato grabbed his bow and arrow and went to investigate.\n\nHidesato reached the horse graveyard and waited until nightfall. When the hour of the ox came, an enormous demon appeared and ravenously began devouring horse carcasses. The demon stood over ten feet tall, had sharp, spiked hair, and was covered in glowing eyes all over its body. Hidesato carefully aimed an arrow at the brightest glowing eyeball and fired. The arrow hit its mark, and the demon roared in pain, fleeing into the woods until it finally collapsed at the foot of Mount Myōjin.\n\nThe battle was not over, for although the demon was near-fatally wounded, it still had power left. From its body erupted a torrent of flame. Its mouth split open and poisonous fumes spewed forth. The toxic air and intense heat proved too much for Fujiwara no Hidesato, who had to give up and return to his palace. When Hidesato returned the next day, the ground was blackened and burnt over a large area, but there was no sign of the demon.\n\n400 years later, during the Muromachi period, the dodomeki finally reappeared. A village had sprung up on the northern slope of Mount Myōjin, and strange things had begun happening. The temple’s head priest had been suffering mysterious injuries and unexplained fires began to break out at the temple. A new head priest, the virtuous and holy Saint Chitoku, was called to discover what the cause of the strange problems was.\n\nSaint Chitoku noticed that one young woman stopped by the temple frequently whenever he preached his sermons, and recognized it as the dodomeki in disguise. The demon, terribly wounded, had retreated into some caves nearby to heal. It transformed into a young woman, and had been visiting the site where it fell, gradually sucking back up all of the noxious fumes that it had breathed out, and collecting all of the blood that it had bled in the battle with Fujiwara no Hidesato. The village temple had been built on top of the battle site, and the dodomeki caused the fires and attacked the priest to scare them away.\n\nOne day, Saint Chitoku confronted the demon in disguise, and she finally revealed her true form was a dodomeki. She did not attack him, however; while frequenting the temple, she had overheard Chitoku’s powerful sermons, and they had stuck with her. The dodomeki promised that she would never again commit any act of evil. Since then, the area around Mount Myōjin has come to be known as Dodomeki.\n\n",

They are the ghosts of people who died with such strong passions—jealousy, rage, or hatred—that their soul is unable to pass on. Instead, they transform into powerful, wrathful spirits who seek vengeance on everything they encounter. Often they were victims of war, catastrophe, betrayal, murder, or suicide—and they display wounds or marks indicative of the way they died.\n\nInteractions: Their motive is always the same—vengeance. Onryō are easily powerful enough to kill anyone. However, they prefer letting the object of their hatred live a long life of torment and suffering, watching loved ones die in their stead. Onryō inflict a terrible curse on the people or places that they haunt. This curse can be transmitted to others like a contagious disease, creating a circle of death and destruction far more devastating than any ordinary ghost. Onryō make no distinction in their targets; they just want to destroy. Moreover, an onryō’s vengeance can never be satisfied. While most yūrei only haunt a person or place until they are exorcised or placated, an onryō’s horrible grudge-curse continues to infect a location long after the ghost itself has been laid to rest.\n\nOccasionally, an onryō’s curse is born not out of hatred and retribution, but from an intense, passionate love that perverts into jealousy. These onryō haunt their former lovers, exacting their wrath on new romances, second marriages, new children, and eventual end up destroying the lives of the ones they loved so much in life. Whatever the origin, an onryō’s undiscriminating wrath makes it one of the most feared supernatural entities in all of Japan.\n\nLegends: Unquestionably the most well-known onryō, and one whose grudge-curse exists to this very day, is the ghost of Oiwa. A young woman who was brutally disfigured and then murdered by her wicked and greedy husband in an elaborate plot, her story is told in Yotsuya kaidan, or The Ghost Story of Yotsuya. Yotsuya kaidan has been retold many times, in books, ukiyoe, kabuki, and film. Like Shakespeare’s Macbeth, legend has it that a curse accompanies her story, and that those who retell it suffer injuries and even death. To this day, producers, actors, and their crews continue to visit the grave of Oiwa in Tōkyō before productions or adaptations of Yotsuya kaidan, praying for her soul and asking for her blessing to tell her story once again.\n\n",

Sōjōbō is a fearsome, powerful, wise, god-like monster, with the strength of 1000 ordinary tengu. He is a master swordsman, and was responsible for training a number of famous legendary heroes of Japan, such as Minamoto no Yoshitsune.

He was born a human, and became a well respected high priest. He was also proud, and he mistakenly believed that he had achieved satori, or enlightenment. Though he expected to become a Buddha when he died, he transformed instead into a demonic tengu. Even as a tengu, the proud Sōjōbō continued to live as a Buddhist priest, training daily, and wearing his ornate priestly vestments.

They can speak, and are sent by the gods to deliver important messages to humanity such as warnings about epidemics.\n\nBehavior: Like most prophetic yōkai, nothing is known of yogen no tori’s natural behavior, as they are only seen when there is an important message to deliver.\n\nInteractions: In addition to delivering an important message, yogen no tori are such holy animals that merely an image of them is enough to keep the evil spirits which cause disease away. Regularly looking at a picture of a yogen no tori is said to protect the viewer from harm.\n\nOrigin: The story of the yogen no tori follows an Edo Period pattern of yokai warning about outbreaks and offering their image as protection. Contagious diseases like cholera are spread by invisible means, and for a long time there were no known cures or methods of protection against them. Amulets, talismans, and image of holy yōkai might not have done much to actually prevent sickness, but the willingness of people to cling to their promise of salvation is understandable.\n\nLegends: A serious cholera outbreak struck Japan in the summer of 1858. During the outbreak, a government official from Kai Province (Yamanashi Prefecture) named Kizaemon, discovered the legend of the yogen no tori and reported it in Bōshabyō ryūkō nikki, a journal detailing the outbreak.\n\nAccording to his report, a yogen no tori was sighted in December of 1857 near Mount Haku in Kaga Province (present-day Ishikawa Prefecture). The bird foretold, “Around August or September of next year, a disaster will occur, killing 90% of the world’s population. Those who gaze upon my image morning and night and believe in me will be spared from this suffering.”\n\nKizaemon believed the yogen no tori to be a messenger from the gods. He declared it to be a symbol of the great power of Kumano Gongen. An illustration of the bird was printed alongside the report so people could see it and receive its protective powers.\n\n",

It also appears in the Heian-period encyclopedia Wamyo Ruijusho (938 CE), and again in the Heike Monogatari (1371 CE), a record of one of Japan’s bloodiest civil wars and most tragic family clans. It has the head of a monkey, the body of a tanuki, the tail of a snake, and the limbs of a tiger. In ancient times it was thought to be a kind of nocturnal bird — it’s call is supposed to sound like that of a White’s thrush — and thus its name is written with a kanji that contains the meanings “night” and “bird.”\n\nBehavior: Little is known about the nue’s natural habitate and lifestyle. While sightings throughout history have been rare, nue are are considered to be pretty evil monsters. The few times that humans and nue have crossed paths, the results have been disastrous.\n\nLegends: One famous nue attack occured in the summer of 1153 in Kyoto. Emperor Konoe began to have nightmares every night, and grew very ill. Neither medicine nor prayers had any effect on his illness, and the source was attributed to some kind of evil spirit which was visiting the palace every night, early in the morning. These events climaxed some days later in a storm which appeared over the imperial palace around 2 AM. Lightning struck the roof, setting it on fire. The emperor summoned the legendary samurai Minamoto no Yorimasa, to deal with the evil spirit. Yorimasa brought his trusted companion, I no Hayata, and his legendary bow which he received from Minamoto no Yorimitsu, to hunt the best. During the night, a strange wind came over them, followed by a black cloud. Yorimasa fired his arrow into the clouds above the palace, and out from the sky came a horrible scream as a nue dropped to the earth. I no Hayata leaped upon the body, dealing it a finishing blow. The emperor immediately recovered from his illness, and rewarded the heroes with the legendary katana Shishiō for their service. This event has been immortalized in numerous paintings and ukiyoe prints.\n\nAfter the nue was slain, the inhabitants of Kyoto were afraid of a retaliatory curse for killing the beast, so they loaded its body in a ship and sent it down the Kamo river. The boat with the nue’s body eventually washed up on the shore near the village of Ashiya, in Hyogo prefecture. The good citizens of Ashiya removed the nue’s body, built it a burial mound, and gave it a proper funeral. You can still visit the mound, known as Nuezuka, today.\n\n",

In public, an inugami looks identical to an ordinary dog in order to blend in with society. However, its true form is that of a desiccated, mummified dog’s head, often dressed up in ceremonial trappings. This is kept safe (and away from prying eyes) in a secret shrine in its owner’s house.\n\nBehavior: Inugami have much in common with other familiars, such as shikigami and kitsune-tsuki. Inugami are more commonly used in areas where foxes are not found, such as major population centers. There is even evidence of an ancient tradition of Inugami worship stretching from Western Japan down to Okinawa. Powerful sorcerers were said to be able to create these spirits through monstrous ceremonies and use them to all sorts of nefarious deeds. Inugami serve their masters loyally, performing tasks just like a faithful dog. They are loyal to one person or one family only, and unless seriously mistreated they remain loyal forever; these spirits can be passed down from generation to generation like an heirloom.\n\nThe technique for creating these fetishes was passed down along bloodlines, and such families are known as inugami-mochi. These families would keep their inugami hidden in the back rooms of their houses, under their beds, in dressers, or hidden among water jars. It is said that a family owned as many inugami as there were members of the household, and when a new person joined the family, they too received their own familiar. Inugami were treated like family members by inugami-mochi families, and most of the time would quickly run out to do their master’s bidding any time their master wanted something. However, like living dogs, occasionally a resentful inugami might betray a master that grew too abusive or domineering, savagely biting him to death. And while inugami, like other familiar spirits, were created to bring wealth and prosperity to their families, occasionally they might also cause a family to fall into ruin.\n\nInteractions: Like other tsukimono, or possession spirits, inugami are beings of powerful emotion and are very good at possessing emotionally unstable or weak people. They do so usually by entering through the ears and settling into the internal organs. People who have found themselves possessed by an inugami — or even if it was only suspected that a person might be possessed — were in for some serious misfortune. The only way to be cured of inugami-tsuki is to hire another sorcerer to remove it. This could take a very, very long time and involve a lot of money. Signs of inugami possession include chest pain, pain in the hands, feet, or shoulders, feelings of deep jealousy, and suddenly barking like a dog. Some victims develop intense hunger and turn into gluttons, and it is said that people who die while possessed by an inugami are found with markings all over their body resembling the teeth and claw marks of a dog. Not only humans, but animals like cows and horses, or even inanimate objects, can be possessed by inugami. Tools possessed by such a spirit become totally and completely unusable.\n\nPracticing this sort of black magic was illegal and strongly frowned upon, although that didn’t stop the aristocracy from dabbling in sorcery, known as onmyōdō. If an inugami-mochi family was even suspected of cursing another family, the accused person would be forced to apologize and leave his comfortable estate to live on the outskirts of town, secluded from family, friends, and the comfortable aristocratic life. Even if the alleged victim was eventually cured of his possession, the accused (and all of his offspring for all generations to follow) usually had to maintain a solitary lifestyle, outcast from the rest of society, to be viewed by others as wicked and tainted.\n\nOrigin: How long the practice of creating inugami begun is unknown. However, by the Heian period (some 1000 years ago, at the height of classical Japanese civilization) the practice had already been outlawed along with the use of other animal spirits as tools of sorcery. According to legend, the creation of an inugami is accomplished like this: the head of a starved dog must be cut off (often this was accomplished by chaining a dog up just out of reach of some food, or else burying it up to its neck, so that it would go berserk out of desperate hunger and its head could be cut off at the point of greatest desperation). Then, the severed head is buried in the street — usually a crossroads where many people pass. The trampling of hundreds or thousands of people over this buried head would add to its stress and cause the animal’s spirit to transform into an onryō (a powerful maleficent spirit). Occasionally these severed heads were said to escape and fly about, chasing after food, animated solely by the onryō’s anger — such was the power of the dog’s hunger. The head was then baked or dried and enshrined in a bowl, after which the spirit could be used as a kind of fetish by a wicked sorcerer, doing whatever he or she commanded for the rest of time.\n\n",

Shīsā are smaller and more dog-like than their Japanese (medium sized dog-lion hybrids) and Chinese (large and very lion-like) cousins.\n\nInteractions: Lion-dogs are commonly depicted in East Asian sculpture as guardian deities. Komainu and shishi are nearly always found in pairs, yet it is common to find solitary shīsā perched on the roofs of houses that they guard. Chinese shishi are usually used as imperial guardians, Japanese komainu are usually used as shrine guardians, and Ryukyuan shīsā are usually used as house or village guardians, perched on rooftops, village gates, castles, or gravesites.\n\nShīsā are also depicted as shrine guardians, with male/female pairs representing the “a” and “un” sounds. This behavior was likely imported from Japan after the Ryukyu islands were conquered. However there is disagreement over the genders. In most depictions, the right, open-mouthed shīsā is the male, beckoning good luck and fortune, while the left, close-mouthed shīsā is the female, protecting the village from natural disasters and evil spirits. In other depictions, the open-mouthed shīsā is the female and the closed-mouthed shīsā is the male.\n\nOrigin: Shīsā are very close relatives to komainu, and share the same ancestor: China’s imperial guardian lions. However, while komainu arrived in mainland Japan via Korea, shīsā were imported to the Ryukyu islands directly from China, before Okinawa was part of Japan. In fact, the name shīsā is actually the Ryukyuan pronunciation of their Chinese name, shishi, which is also sometimes used for komainu in Japanese.\n\n",

These parties were called hyakumonogatari kaidankai—a gathering of one hundred ghost stories. During a game of hyakumonogatari kaidankai, one hundred candles would be lit and placed inside of blue paper lanterns, called andon. The andon created an eerie atmosphere suitable for storytelling. Throughout the night, guests would take turns telling progressively scarier stories about yōkai, demons, ghosts, and other strange things. After each story, one candle would be snuffed out. The room grew gradually darker, until only the hundredth candle remained. Its dim blue light would struggle to fill the room, and cast long, creepy shadows.\n\nBehavior: According to superstition, after the final candle was snuffed an actual spirit would appear out of the darkness to attack the participants. Summoned by the heightened emotional state and fears of guests, this spirit was called the ao andon. The ao andon would emerge from the smoke of the final candle and attacks the guests. What exactly this attack consists of is a mystery; whether the ao andon slaughters all of the participants in a brutal finale inspired by the preceding tales, or simply jumps out to give one last shock before the guests return home has never been recorded. The reason for this is that by the time the ninety-ninth ghost story had been told, the guests were too frightened to tell the final story. Hyakumonogatari kaidankai parties traditionally concluded before the final candle could be snuffed and the ao andon could appear.\n\nOrigin: As the old proverb says (in both English and Japanese): speak of the devil, and the devil appears. It was believed that merely talking about ghosts and spirits would cause them to materialize for real.\n\n",

The jatai hunts after men, strangling them in their sleep.\n\n",

One common origin is when a prostitute dies in vain, after working for many years to save up the money to buy her freedom. Upon death, such women usually had their clothes donated to a temple in exchange for a funeral and prayers. However, if the woman died still owed money from some of her clients, her spirit might reanimate her old clothing and head off in revenge. The newly formed kosode no te leaves the temple to find the prostitute’s customers and scare them into to paying the money owed.\n\nAnother origin is when a dead person’s kimono is sold for cash instead of being donated to a temple, as is customary. If the deceased was unable to properly pass on to nirvana upon death, that person’s spirit may come back and haunt their former kimono.\n\n",

However, local accounts vary greatly in details such as size, number of eyes, and habitat. In Okayama, they are described as two-eyed giants who take up residence in abandoned or uninhabited homes. In other stories, they appear in wheat fields, or on dark, lonely roads.\n\nInteractions: In Shizuoka, ao bōzu are said to appear on spring evenings at sunset in the wheat and barley fields. The transition from night to day is a popular theme in the tradition of in-yō sorcery. Further, the still blue-green leaves of the young barley also have powerful connections to in-yō. Children who go running and playing through the fields in the evening might be snatched up and taken away by an ao bōzu. Thus, good children must go straight home after school and not go tramping through the fields!\n\nIn Kagawa, ao bōzu appear late at night to young women and ask them, “Would you like to hang by your neck?” If the woman says no, the ao bōzu disappears without a word. However, if she ignores him or says nothing, he attacks her with lightning speed, knocks her out, and hangs her by the neck.\n\nIn Yamaguchi, they are considered minor deities. They appear before humans on the road and challenge them to sumo matches. Because Yamaguchi’s ao bōzu are only as big as children, many a person has foolishly accepted the challenge, only to find himself flung to the ground with god-like strength and potentially lethal speed.\n\nOrigin: Very little is known about this yokai. Toriyama Sekien was the first to record the ao bōzu, and his illustration came with not a single word of description other than its name. From its name, we can glean a little bit of information; the word ao means blue or green, and can denote immaturity and inexperience. (Another well-known yokai — ao-nyōbō — uses this color in a similar manner.) As the original illustration was black-and-white, it may even be that this yokai was never intended to be colored blue or green, but rather just as a mockery of what Toriyama Sekien saw as a corrupt and unskilled priesthood. Nonetheless, thanks to its name, it is usually depicted in a sickly shade of ao.\n\nThe fact that ao bōzu has only one eye and is revered as a minor god in some places draws a strong parallel with another yokai, the hitotsume-kozō. Because of his similarity, there are theories suggesting a connection to the ancient spirit worship of old Japan. In these shamanistic proto-religions, one-eyed monsters often originated as fallen mountain gods and bringers of evil, sent to do the bidding of larger deities. They could be kept at bay with woven baskets, or other objects with many holes, which the monsters would view as hundreds of eyes and avoid, either out of fear or jealousy.\n\nBecause there are so many different accounts, and because there are so many different kinds of nasty priest yokai, it’s impossible to tell which, if any, is the real ao bōzu, and which are variations of other kinds of yokai.\n\n",

It lives deep in the mountains of Japan. It is especially well-known in the mountains bordering Wakayama and Nara Prefectures (old Kii and Yamato Provinces), though sightings have been reported in other neighboring prefectures as well.\n\nBehavior: Ippondatara is a shy yōkai, and tends to stay away from inhabited areas. It moves about by hopping around and doing somersaults. It avoids humans, though on winter days it is not uncommon to find the unique prints of this yōkai’s large, single foot in the snow.\n\nInteractions: While it is mostly harmless, once per year on December 20th, the ippondatara turns violent. Those entering the mountains on that day who run into the ippondatara are squashed flat under its powerful foot. Because of this, December 20th is considered an unlucky day in the areas where this yōkai lives. People stay out of the mountains then.\n\nOrigin: The name ippondatara comes from tatara, the bellows that a blacksmith would use in the old days. This yōkai is said to resemble a master blacksmith who lost the use of one eye from years of starting at the intense flames, and lost the use of one leg from years of heavy work pumping the bellows.\n\nThere are many theories about the origin of this yōkai. In some villages, it is considered to be a cousin of a certain breed of kappa called gōrai which—every winter—transform from river spirits into mountain spirits called kashambo until they return to the rivers in spring. Ippondatara is said to be a kind of kashambo.\n\nOther explanations describe the ippondatara as the ghost of a woodcutter who cut off one of his legs in penance for some crime. Or it may be the ghost of a famous one-legged, one-eyed robber named Hitotsudatara who lived in the mountains of Wakayama and had supernatural strength. It may even be the ghost of a giant boar who used to roam the mountains killing hunters. A high priest was able to bind the boar’s spirit and keep it from harming people, but the conditions of the magic that binds this ghost allow it to roam free one day per year—on December 20th.\n\nIt has also been suggested that it is a kind of mountain kami which was corrupted over the ages and became a yōkai. A single eye is a common feature among mountain spirits, and other one-eyed yōkai (such as hitotsume kozō) originated as mountain kami as well.\n\n",

Its facial expression resembles that of a person who is about to vomit; its mouth is open and its eyes are tiny pinpoints.\n\nInteractions: People infected with kakuran no mushi suffer symptoms similar to food poisoning: frequent diarrhea and vomiting. This infection can be cured by taking goshuyu, a medicine made from a dried, unripe fruit (Tetradium ruticarpum).\n\nIn one record of a kakuran no mushi infection, this yōkai’s head was briefly visible in its host’s mouth during a particularly violent bout of vomiting. A friend of the victim grabbed the kakuran no mushi’s head to try to pull it out, but when he did, the victim became very weak and seemed as if he was about to lose consciousness. The friend let go of the head, and the kakuran no mushi retreated back into its hosts body. Afterwards, the victim died. When an autopsy was performed, the doctor found the kakuran no mushi wrapped up around its host’s liver so tightly that he couldn’t remove it. The doctor ground up shazenshi (Plantago asiatica) and mokkō (Saussurea costus) and sprinkled it on the kakuran no mushi, and the creature disappeared.\n\n",

Until of course, they get too close….\n\nFrom behind, an ohaguro bettari looks like a beautiful woman wearing a kimono—often looking like a newlywed in her bridal gown. She appears at twilight outside of a temple, or inside a man’s own house, disguised as his wife. At first, she conceals her head, or turns away from any viewers. Any man who comes closer to get a better look is surprised when she turns to reveal her face: an ugly, white, featureless dome slathered in thick makeup, containing nothing but a huge, gaping mouth full of blackened teeth. She follows up this initial shock with a horrible cackle, sending the man running away and screaming in terror.\n\nOrigin: Ohaguro bettari are similar to a yōkai called nopperabō in appearance and demeanor.

Accurate eye-witness reports are hard to come by due to the embarrassment of the victims at having fallen for such an obvious gag. However as no deaths or injuries (other than to pride) have been attributed to ohaguro bettari, and because sightings are rare, a mischievous shape-shifting animal yōkai seems to be a plausible explanation.\n\n",

It usually takes the form of a handful of pebbles or gravel flying through the air on an evil wind, however from time to even even boulders are blown about in this way.\n\nInteractions: People who are struck by tengu tsubute usually fall ill soon afterwards.

And no matter how hard a person is struck by a tengu tsubute, no wound or mark is left on the body.\n\nOrigin: Because these rocks fly as if thrown from seemingly nowhere, this phenomenon is believed to be the work of tengu (or other yōkai—occasionally mischievous kitsune and tanuki are blamed as well).

It is said appearances can be deceiving, and nurarihyon is the perfect illustration of this. Overall, he is rather benign-looking; his head is elongated and gourd-shaped; his face is wizened and wrinkled, resembling a cross between and old man and a catfish; he wears elegant clothing—often a splendid silk kimono or the rich robes of a Buddhist abbot—and carries himself in the quiet manner of a sophisticated gentleman.\n\nBehavior: The short, comical, elderly nurarihyon is actually the most powerful and elite of all the yōkai. He travels in an ornate palanquin carried by human or yōkai servants, often visiting red light districts but occasionally stopping at mountain villas as well. Nurarihyon is known as kaibutsu no oyadama—the supreme commander of all monsters. Every yōkai listens to his words and pays him respect, treating him as the elder and leader in all yōkai meetings. Along with otoroshi and nozuchi, nurarihyon leads the procession known as the night parade of one hundred demons through the streets of Japan on dark, rainy nights. He fits the role of supreme commander every bit as much when he interacts with humans as well.\n\nInteractions: Nurarihyon shows up on evenings when a household is extremely busy. He arrives at homes unexpectedly in his splendid palanquin and slips into the house, unnoticed by anyone. He acts in all respects as if he were the master of the house, helping himself to the family’s luxuries such as fine teas and tobacco. His power is so great that even the real owners of the house can do nothing to stop him. In fact, even after they finally notice his presence, the owners believe the nurarihyon to actually be the rightful master of the house. Eventually he leaves just as he came, quietly and politely slipping out of the house and into his palanquin, as the owners of the house obsequiously bow and wave him farewell. Only after he has left does anyone become suspicious of the mysterious old man who just visited.\n\nOrigin: As to nurarihyon’s origins there is only speculation. The oldest records of his existence are mere sketches and paintings. His name comes from nurari (“to slip away”) and hyon (an onomatopoeia describing floating upwards) written with the kanji for gourd (due to the shape of his head). This connotes a slippery evasiveness—which he employs when posing as master of the house.\n\nIn Okayama Prefecture, some evidence links nurarihyon to umi bōzu. There, nurarihyon are globe-shaped sea creatures, about the size of a man’s head, which float about in the Seto Inland Sea. When fisherman try to catch one, the sphere sinks down into the water just out of reach, and then bobs back up mockingly. It has been theorized that some of these slippery globes migrate to land, where they gradually gain influence and power, becoming the nurarihyon known throughout the rest of Japan. Whether this theory is the true origin of the Supreme Commander of All Monsters or just one more of his many mysteries has yet to be solved.\n\n",

He is famous for being clever, quick-witted, and somewhat insolent. But he is even more famous for his side job in hell as an attendant to Great King Enma.\n\nLegends: Near the temple Rokudōchinnō-ji in Kyōto, there is a spot where the boundary between the world of the dead and the world of the living can be crossed. There are many stories in that area of ghosts returning to this world and trying to buy candy from stores, or visiting lost relatives. Ono no Takamura knew of this, and discovered a way to travel freely between the world of the dead and the world of the living. He would enter the underworld every night by climbing down a well located in the garden of Rokudōchinnō-ji, and return every morning by climbing out of a well located in the temple Sagano Fukusei-ji.\n\nAccording to one legend, a nobleman named Fujiwara no Yoshimi fell very ill and died soon after. His soul crossed the Sanzu River, and traveled to Meido to be judged. When he reached the court of King Enma, a familiar voice spoke up from the darkness next to the judge and said, “I know this soul. In life, he served as an imperial minister, and was a noble and virtuous man. Please trust my judgment and return him to life.” When Yoshimi raised his head, he saw that the voice belonged to Ono no Takamura—and he was serving as one of King Enma’s councilors! King Enma replied, “Well, if you say so I suppose it can’t be helped,” and ordered his hell-guards to return Yoshimi to the world of the living.\n\nA few days later, Fujiwara no Yoshimi approached Ono no Takamura at the imperial court. When Yoshimi asked Takamura about what he saw in Meido, Takamura appeared troubled and replied, “My work there is actually a secret, so please don’t tell anybody else about what you saw…” Afterwards, Yoshimi began to grow more and more fearful of Takamura’s power and position. Rumors spread through the capital that Takamura was King Enma’s right hand man. Many feared him.\n\nRokudōchinnō-ji still stands in Kyōto today. In the Enma Hall, right next to the statue of Great King Enma is another statue—one of Ono no Takamura. The well which Takamura used to enter the world of the dead still remains on the temple garden; however Sagano Fukusei-ji no longer stands, and the place where Takamura’s exit well once stood is now a bamboo forest.\n\n",

The sound of this explosion is said to be louder than a gunshot. Everything nearby is splattered with their flesh, blood, and innards.\n\nOrigin: Kodama nezumi are attested to by the Matagi, an ethnic group of hunters who live in the mountains of northeastern Japan. They believe that kodama nezumi are messenger animals sent by mountain gods. A kodama nezumi explosion is a warning that the gods are angry. When Matagi hunters hear this sound, they immediately stop their hunt and return home.\n\nAnyone foolish enough to continue hunting after hearing a kodama nezumi explosion will have a poor catch. Worse, they invite the wrath of the mountain gods.

She begged them for shelter for the night. However, the mountains were sacred. Women were forbidden from entering them. And so the hunters had no choice but to turned her away.\n\nThe woman continued wandering until she came upon another hut. Once again begged the hunters inside to give her shelter for the night. These hunters also knew the law, but they took pity on the woman. It was too dangerous to roam the mountains at night, so they allowed her stay.\n\nWhen morning came, the woman had vanished. The hunters who allowed her to stay had a successful hunt. Nobody was injured, and they all returned to their village laden with rich game. In fact, the woman was actually a mountain goddess, and she had blessed their hunt.\n\nThe group of hunters who turned her away, however, met a different fate.

Their bodies are about 4.5 to 5 meters long and their heads are around 90 centimeters long. They have long black hair and two horns sprout from the top of their heads. They are creatures of good luck, and viewing an image of them will protect the viewer from disease and evil spirits.\n\nInteractions: Hime uo are servants of Ryūjin and spend their lives deep underwater. They only appear to humans when they have an important message to deliver from the dragon god, such as warnings of coming plagues.\n\nOrigin: A hime uo was sighted in 1819 near the island of Hirado in what is now Nagasaki Prefecture. The hime uo’s words and its details, including body length, hair length, and color, were recorded and printed along with an illustration and distributed like flyers around the country. Due to the instructions that its image should be hung in every house for protection, countless copies of these flyers were made. Some were printed, while others were hand-copied, resulting in a vast number of slightly different depictions of hime uo being circulated across Japan. Some have long hair, some have short hair. Some have pointy horns, others have deer-like antlers. Some are bearded. Some have breasts. The number of swords in their tails varies as well.\n\nSeveral other yōkai originate from the same story. While they seem to be the same creature, originating from Hirado, Nagasaki in 1819, the depictions vary in several details including the size and shape of the fish. They tend to divided up based on their appearance—with the shorter fish-like ones categorized as hime uo, the longer, serpentine ones categorized as jinja hime, and others with local names such as kamiike hime.\n\nLegends: On April 8, 1819, a strange fish appeared off the coast of Hirado, Hizen Province. The fish delivered a warning: “I am a messenger from Ryūjin. In seven years time a disease called cholera will break out across the country and many people will die. However, if you hang my picture in your house, it will ward off the sickness and your descendants will thrive. I have come now to deliver this message to you.” Then the strange fish disappeared back into the sea.\n\n",

            "content": "風の神\nかぜのかみTranslation: wind spirit\nHabitat: rides on the windAppearance: Kaze no kami are formless, invisible evil spirits. Despite being invisible, they are usually portrayed in paintings as old, sickly, ape-like demons wearing ragged loincloths. They inflict suffering upon humans both through their control of the wind, and through the illness that they spread.\n\nInteractions: Kaze no kami ride the wind, traveling from place to place in order to spread illness. They slip into homes through small cracks and crevices, sensing the temperature differences between the warmer inside air and colder outside air. When they encounter people, they exhale clouds of humid, yellow breath. Any human bathed in this toxic air will become sick.\n\nIn addition to spreading disease with their breath, kaze no kami can control the flow of the wind itself. Workers whose livelihoods were greatly influenced by the wind, such as farmers and fishers, feared the capricious nature of kaze no kami. In many places they were even enshrined as gods in order to avoid provoking their wrath.\n\nOrigin: The yellow breath which kaze no kami exhale may be a representation of the yellow dust which falls upon Japan, especially in the early spring. Wind erosion of northern China’s Huangtu Plateau stirs large amounts of silt up into the atmosphere. The silt then falls down upon Japan and other East Asian countries in the form of yellow dust. It causes respiratory issues and can even darken the sky on particularly heavy days. The combination of early spring’s temperature fluctuations, humid winds, and yellow dust often cause people to feel sick. In old times, this was believed to be the work of malicious spirits.\n\nWhile advancements in medicine eventually ended the belief in wind spirits as carriers of disease, the superstition is preserved in the Japanese word for the common cold—kaze—which translates to “evil wind.” Similarly, the phrase kaze ni au—”to encounter the wind”—means to have bad luck or to suddenly fall sick.\n\n",

These spirits manifest their grudge late at night, and bring misfortune upon those living in the house.\n\nBehavior: Sakabashira are most well-known for making noises. They creak and moan, imitate the sounds of wooden beams cracking, and sometimes even speak in sentences like, “My neck hurts!” They can cause houses to shake, and the leaf-spirits residing in the tree can manifest as yanari, acting like poltergeists and breaking things around the house. Sakabashira can be so loud that families often move out of a house that is haunted by one, for these yokai cause not only strange noises, but also terrible luck. People who stay in a house haunted by a sakabashira often lose their family fortunes, or even lose all of their possessions to great conflagrations which consume and destroy the cursed house.\n\nOrigin: It has long been a folk belief that a pillar erected in the upside-down position will bring misfortune to a family, and a sakabashira is usually the result of a careless mistake on the part of the construction crew. In order to prevent this yokai from appearing, folk superstition tells us that a pillar must be erected in the same orientation as the tree had when it was alive. However, sometimes support pillars are actually installed this way on purpose. The reason for this is another folk belief: “The moment a house is completed, it starts to fall apart.” As a kind of ward against bad luck, Japanese buildings were sometimes only almost completed, with the final step being left out, or purposefully made into a mistake. The famous Tosho-gu shrine at Nikko is such an example, having been built with just one pillar purposefully pointing in the opposite direction. This same superstition was followed when building the imperial palace — placing the final pillar in an upside-down position. During the Edo period, house builders commonly “forgot” to place the last three roof tiles for the same reason.\n\n",

They can also be found in the employ of powerful spirits such as Kame hime of Inawashiro Castle.\n\nLegends: One cold autumn evening, two men traveling from Echigo to Edo found themselves lost in the mountains. Night was fast approaching, when up ahead they spotted a lonely, crooked, old cottage alongside the road. They knocked on the door of the cottage and begged for shelter for the night.\n\nAn old woman in her seventies was inside, spinning cloth from ramie. She welcomed the two men into the hovel, and did her best to make them comfortable. She put some dried leaves into the hearth to start a fire, and boiled water to make tea. The two men were grateful for the simple hospitality, and soon fell asleep.\n\nOne of the travelers awoke from his slumber with a funny feeling. Squinting in the darkness, he thought he saw the old woman leaning over his traveling partner and licking his face with an impossibly long tongue. The man was startled and coughed, and suddenly the old woman moved back to the hearth and nonchalantly continued spinning ramie.\n\nA moment later their was a gruff voice at the window: “Oi, shitanaga uba! It’s shunobon. What’s taking you so long? Let me give you a hand.” Another monster entered the hovel. It stood about two meters tall and had a large scarlet face that resembled a lacquered tray.\n\nThe traveler drew his sword and jumped at the shunobon. As he slashed, the spirit vanished into thin air. Meanwhile, the old woman grabbed the sleeping companion and ran out the front door. An instant later, the entire hovel vanished, and the traveler found himself in the middle of an abandoned field.\n\nAlone, helpless, and lost in the dark, the man curled up in the roots of a tree and slept. When morning came, there was no sign of the hovel or the old woman. In a thicket nearby, he discovered the remains of his travel companion: a bleached white skeleton, licked completely clean.\n\n",

Their long necks stick straight up out of the center of their bodies, and they have manes of long hair.\n\nBehavior: There is only been one recorded arie sighting, so little is known about these yōkai. They live in the ocean, they can speak and deliver prophecies, and they are powerful good spirits whose image alone is enough to drive away evil disease spirits.\n\nOrigin: The only known arie sighting was reported on June 17, 1876, in the Kōfu hibi shimbun. The article was printed along with an illustration of the arie. Their story is virtually identical to that of many other aquatic prophetic yokai which appeared in the latter half of the 19th century, including amabie, amabiko, jinja hime, and many others. Just like these others, arie emerge from the sea to deliver a dual prophecy about a bountiful harvest followed by an epidemic of disease, and then instruct people to copy their image before disappearing shortly after.\n\nLegends: A strange creature was sighted in the waters off of Higo Province (present day Kumamoto Prefecture). After nightfall, the creature emerged from the water and began walking to and fro along the roadside, calling out to people. The passersby were scared, and so nobody approached the creature. Eventually the flow of traffic died out.\n\nA government official heard the rumors about the strange creature, and went to see it for himself. When he approached the creature, it spoke to him: “I am the leader of the scaled beasts of the sea. I am called arie. The arie went then foretold a six year bumper crop, and an outbreak of cholera. He instructed the government official that anyone who hangs up its image and prays to it would be protected from the disaster.\n\nAfter delivering its message, the arie retreated back into the sea.\n\n",

This troubled attachment manifests as a ghost known as an ubume. These women appear on dark, rainy nights. Ubume can appear in many forms: a woman carrying a baby; a pregnant woman; or a blood-soaked walking corpse carrying an underdeveloped fetus. Other times they just appear as horrific, bloody, pregnant women crying out desperately into the night for help.\n\nThese variations are due to the burial traditions of different regions, as well as the circumstances of their death. In some areas, when a pregnant woman died she would be buried with the unborn fetus still inside of her. In other places, the fetus would be cut out of her and placed in her arms during burial. Women who died after delivering stillborn babies were also buried this way.\n\nBehavior: These tragic spirits wander the areas near where they died, seeking aid from the living which they cannot provide themselves. If the mother died after childbirth but her baby survived, the newly formed ubume will try to care for the child in whatever way it can. She enters shops or homes to try to purchase food, clothes, or sweets for her still-living child. In place of money she pays with handfuls of dead leaves. These ghosts also try to lead humans to the place where their baby is hidden so that it can be taken to its living relatives, or adopted by another person.\n\nIn cases where both mother and child died, an ubume can appear carrying the bundled corpse of her infant. When a human approaches, the ghost tries to deliver the bundle into the arms of the living. If the stranger accepts, the ghost vanishes, and the bundle grows heavier and heavier until the helpful stranger is crushed under its weight.\n\nOther forms: The name ubume is written with characters that imply a bird’s name. The literal translation of these characters is “child-snatching bird” and some theories connect this spirit with another yōkai called the ubumetori. This yōkai is an evil bird which flies through the sky searching for clothing that has been left on the clothesline overnight. When it finds some, it smears its poisonous blood on the clothing. Shortly afterward, the owner of those clothes begins to develop shakes and convulsions; possibly leading to death. Ubumetori are also blamed for snatching babies and taking them away into the night sky. Whether this bird is another form of the ghostly mother or a separate spirit with a similar name is not known.\n\n",

They wear shaved heads and robes, like tiny Buddhist monks. They have long red tongues and a single, enormous eye.\n\nBehavior: Hitotsume kozō are relatively harmless as far as yōkai go. Their most alarming trait is appearing suddenly and surprising people on dark streets. They seem to enjoy startling people; hundreds of encounters have been reported over the years, most of them very similar to each other.\n\nInteractions: Aside from their startling play, hitotsume kozō have one serious job. In East Japan, it is said that every year on the 8th of December, hitotsume kozō travel the land, recording in ledgers the families who have been bad that year. They use this information to decide each family’s fortunes for the coming year. Hitotsume kozō take their reports to the god of pestilence and bad luck, who then brings appropriate misfortune on those deserving families. However, hitotsume kozō leave their ledgers with the guardian deity of travels for safekeeping until February 8th. In a mid-January ceremony, local villagers burn down and rebuild that deity’s roadside shrines in hopes that the fires will also burn the hitotsume kozō’s ledgers before they come to pick them up—thus escaping disaster that year.\n\nOrigin: Though similar in name to other one-eyed monsters like hitotsume nyūdō, there is little evidence suggesting a relation between the two. Many believe that hitotsume kozō’s origins are connected in some way with Enryaku-ji, the head temple of the Tendai sect of Buddhism. Others believe that they were once local mountain deities who over time devolved and changed into yōkai.\n\nLegends: A man visited a friend on business. While waiting in the reception room, a young boy of about 10 appeared and began to mischievously roll and unroll the hanging scroll in the room’s alcove. When the man scolded the boy for being mischievous, the boy turned around and squawked, “Be quiet!” However, the boy’s face had only one eye! The man screamed and fainted, and had to be carried back to his own home. He was bed-ridden for 20 days, but made a full recovery.\n\nIn an account from Fukushima Prefecture, a young lady was walking the street at night. A little boy approached her from behind and asked “Ma’am, would you like some money.” She laughed and sweetly replied yes, and turned to face the boy. He was a hitotsume kozō. Instead of bearing riches and he was grinning, staring so intensely at her with his single eye that she fainted in shock on the spot.\n\nA similar tale from Okayama Prefecture tells of a particular street where an eerie, pale blue glow was seen one night. A man went to investigate and witnessed a ghostly one-eyed boy playing around. The man collapsed, paralyzed with fear, and was unable to move. The apparition approached the helpless man and licked him from head to toe with his long, slobbery tongue.\n\n",

They are usually said to have three legs, although some sightings of four-legged amabiko have been reported.\n\nBehavior: Very little is known about amabiko, as they have only appeared a few times in history, and only briefly. They live in the seas around Japan, and have been spotted in Kyūshū as well as along the Sea of Japan coast. All amabiko sightings follow the same pattern: an amabiko emerges from the sea and delivers a prophecy. It foretells a period of bountiful harvest, followed by a period of disaster and disease. It instructs people to copy its image to use as protection against disease. Then it disappears.\n\nOrigin: During the latter half of the 19th century, Japan experienced a number of severe epidemics. It was believed that evil spirits were responsible for spreading disease, and that an effective way to keep them away was to display pictures of powerful good spirits. During this time there were a large number of sightings of prophetic savior yōkai, all of whom fall into the same pattern as amabiko. These yōkai appear briefly, present a prophecy, and then vanish. Newspapers circulated their stories, along with illustrations of the yōkai for people to hang in their homes as protective charms.\n\nOther famous soothsaying yōkai include amabie, hakutaku, hōnengame, jinja hime, and kudan. Of these, amabie’s story and physical description are so similar to amabiko’s that it has been suggested that they may actually be the same yōkai. Amabie may have been created as a result of confusing between the characters コ (ko) and エ (e), which look similar in handwritten script.\n\nAmabiko’s name has been written using a number of different kanji combinations, so the meaning varies from place to place. 尼彦 (nun boy) 天彦 (heavenly boy) 海彦 (sea boy) and 天日子 (sunlight child) have all been used to write its name.

In the play Tenshu monogatari, Kame hime is depicted visiting her older sister at Himeji Castle and bringing a severed man’s head as a souvenir.\n\nOrigin: The name Kame hime comes from Inawashiro Castle’s nickname: Kame shiro (“Turtle Castle”).\n\nLegends: Kame hime’s story takes place in 1640. Inawashiro Castle was owned by Katō Akinari, lord of Aizu Domain. The chamberlain—the person in charge of the castle’s defence— was Horibe Shuzen.\n\nOne day in December, Horibe Shuzen noticed a child who he had never seen before running about the castle. The child turned to Shuzen and said, “Hey you! You have not introduced yourself to the ruler of this castle yet. My lord is receiving visitors today, so hurry up and prepare to pay your respects!”\n\nShuzen was flabbergasted. “Why you…! Katō Akinari is the only lord of this castle, and I, Horibe Shizen, am his chamberlain! How dare you!”\n\nThe child just laughed at him. “So you haven’t heard of Osakabe hime of Himeji and Kame hime of Inawashiro? Then you are already doomed!” Upon saying this, the child vanished.\n\nThere was no sign of the child for some time. However, on New Year’s morning, Shuzen joined the other retainers in the castle’s hall only to see that a coffin and funerary tools had been placed before his seat at the table. He demanded to know who had put them there, but none of the other retainers had any idea.\n\nThat night, Shuzen was haunted by the sound of many people pounding mochi echoing throughout the castle.\n\nNot long after that, Shuzen collapsed in the castle’s toilet. Two days later he was dead.\n\nLater that summer, a seven shaku (2.1 meters) tall ōnyūdō was sighted collecting water near the rice fields surrounding the castle. The castle’s soldiers rushed out and cut the monster down in a single stroke. When they examined the body, it turned out to be a very large mujina. Henceforth, there were no more strange occurrences at Inawashiro Castle.\n\nInawashiro Castle was destroyed in 1868 during the Bōshin War. Today, all that remains are the castle’s stone foundations.\n\n",

Frequently this take the form of a mysterious and deadly fever. These victims join the ranks of the shichinin misaki, replacing the spirit responsible for killing them. Some say that the replaced spirit is then finally able to attain Nirvana. Thus, the number of spirits always remains fixed at seven.\n\nOrigin: The word misaki (御先) means “one who goes before,” and has a number of nuanced meanings. One of these refers to the retainers and servants who would travel in front of a noble or priest’s procession. Another refers to divine animals, particularly ravens, foxes, monkeys, who acted as messengers in the service of higher ranking spirits. Finally, it can refer to spirits (bōrei) of those who died unnatural deaths, and who are able to possess and control the living. Misaki (岬) can also refer to a cape or a peninsula, which might describe why the shichinin misaki are so frequently encountered at the borders between land and sea.\n\nThere are a number of theories about how this self-perpetuating group began. Because they are usually encountered near water, it is said that they may be the ghosts of drowning victims. Some theories describe them as the spirits of Taira soldiers who died in a boar trap while fleeing their enemies during the Genpei War. Others attribute them to the spirits of seven wicked priests who were murdered by a group of townspeople they were tormenting. Others say they are the spirits of seven women pilgrims who were thrown overboard at sea and drowned.\n\nThe most popular story about the shichinin misaki comes from Tōsa Province (present day Kōchi Prefecture) during the Sengoku Period. Kira Chikazane, a senior retainer and nephew of Chōsokabe Motochika. During a crisis of succession within the Chōsobake clan, Chikazane opposed his lord Motochika. As a result, he was later ordered to commit seppuku. Chikazane’s seven retainers also followed him into death by suicide. After that, strange occurrences were reported around the graves of Chikazane and his retainers. These were attributed to their restless, vengeful spirits.\n\nHearing the story of the shichinin misaki, Motochika performed services to appease the restless spirits of Chikazane and his retainers. He built a shrine in Chikazane’s name, which still stands today (the Kira Shrine in Kōchi City); however, none of these had any effect at stopping the vengeance of the shichinin misaki.\n\nEven today, the shichinin misaki are said to haunt Western Japan and Shikoku, and Kōchi City in particular. Traffic accidents and other strange occurrences are blamed on the restless spirits of the shichinin misaki.\n\n",

It is an ugly beast with a large body similar to that of a cow but with a single, sharp claw on each of its four long limbs. According to the accounts that exist, male waira are mottled in earthy brown colors while females are colored red.\n\nBehavior: Waira live deep in the mountains, near heavily wooded temples and shrines.

It is also speculated that the waira is somehow related to the otoroshi, as they share the same habitat and are often seen together.\n\nThe waira’s name, as with the otoroshi’s, is a subject of some confusion. As these yōkai’s names are not written using kanji, they contain few clues as to their origins.

They are followed by a host of eerie birds and strange fish, and appear on rainy nights near coastal whaling villages.\n\nInteractions: In olden days, when whales were still plentiful in the Sea of Japan, a whale sighting was a blessing for the residents of the poor fishing villages. A village could reap huge amounts of wealth from the meat and oil in a single whale. Such a bounty did not come without a price, however. Many fishermen claimed that the souls of these whales lived on as bakekujira, seeking revenge against the humans who took their lives. Those who witnessed a bakekujira were infected with its horrible curse, which they brought back to their villages when they returned home. The whale’s curse brought famine, plague, fires, and other kinds of disasters.\n\nLegends: One rainy night long ago, some fishers living on the Shimane peninsula witnessed an enormous white shape off the coast in the Sea of Japan. Squinting their eyes, it appeared to them to be a whale swimming offshore. Excited for the catch, they rallied the townspeople, who grabbed their spears and harpoons and took to their boats to hunt down and catch their quarry.\n\nThey soon reached the whale, but no matter how many times they hurled their weapons not one of them struck true. When they looked closer, through the dark, rain-spattered water’s surface, they realized why; what they thought was a white whale was actually a humongous skeleton swimming in the sea. It lacked even a single bit of flesh on its body.\n\nAt that moment, the sea became alive with a host of strange fish that nobody had ever seen before. The sky swarmed with eerie birds which nobody could recognize and the likes of which had never been seen before. The ghost whale then turned sharply out to sea, and swiftly vanished into the current, taking all the strange fish and birds with it, never to be seen again.\n\nThe terrified villagers returned home, realizing that the skeletal whale must have been a bakekujira—a whale turned into a vengeful ghost. While the bakekujira was never seen again, other villages in Shimane felt the whale’s curse. They were consumed by conflagrations and plagued by the infectious diseases that followed whale beachings.\n\n",

When a tsubaki tree (Camellia japonica, or the rose of winter) reaches an old age, it’s spirit gains the ability to separate itself from its host tree, along with other strange and mysterious powers, which it uses to bewitch and trick humans.\n\nOrigin: The tsubaki is an evergreen tree which has the strange behavior of not losing its flowers gradually, petal by petal, but dropping them all at once to the ground. As a result, it long been associated with death and strangeness in Japan (and is also taboo to bring as gifts to hospitals or sick people).\n\nLegends: Long ago in Yamagata prefecture, two merchants were walking along a mountain road when they passed a tsubaki tree. Suddenly a beautiful young woman appeared from out of nowhere on the road beside one of the merchants. She breathed on him, and instantly he transformed into a bee. She then disappeared into the tsubaki tree, and the bee followed her and landed on a flower. The fragrance of the tree had turned into poison, however, and as soon as the bee smelled it, it dropped to the ground. The flower soon fell off of the tree too. The other merchant picked up both the bee and the flower and rushed to a nearby temple to save his friend. The priest recited prayers and read the sutras over the bee, but it sadly did not return to life or to its former human form. Afterwards, the surviving merchant buried the bee and the flower together.\n\nIn Akita prefecture, long ago, a man heard a sad and lonely voice coming from the tree one night. A few days later, a disaster befell the temple. This happened again and again, and soon the priests at the temple realized that the tsubaki would cry a warning every time something bad was going to happen. The tree was dubbed Yonaki Tsubaki, or “night-crying tsubaki,” and still stands today in the temple Kanman-ji, where it has stood for over 700 years.\n\nIn Ōgaki, Gifu, there is an ancient burial mound. One year, historians excavated the burial mound and discovered some ancient artifacts, including a mirror and some bones; however, shortly after the man who discovered the artifacts died. The locals blamed it on a curse, and returned the artifacts to the mound, planting a tsubaki on top of it. When the tsubaki grew old, it transformed into a yokai tree. Since then, the glowing figure of a young, beautiful woman has been seen by the roadside near the burial mound at night.\n\n",

These are the shades of drowned sailors which remain in this world, hunting for their former friends and comrades to take them down into the sea. Like many ghosts, funayūrei appear as dead bodies wearing white funerary robes. They can be seen at night, either when the moon is new or full, on particularly stormy or foggy nights, or during the festival of Obon. Funayūrei appear as an eerie, luminescent mist, which gets closer and closer until it forms into a ship with a ghostly crew.\n\nInteractions: Funayūrei ghost ships attack in different ways. Sometimes they charge headlong towards the other ship, causing it to steer away so sharply that it capsizes. Other times they pull alongside the other ship and the ghostly crew tries to drag it down under the water. The ghosts themselves carry large ladles and buckets which they use to fill ships with seawater, sinking the ships and adding more souls to the funayūrei crew. Occasionally funayūrei strike not as a large crew of man-sized ghosts, but as one very large ghost who rises out of the water to capsize a ship immediately. This ghost often demands a barrel from the crew, which it uses to flood the deck and sink the ship. Giant funayūrei are often confused with umi bōzu, which appear and attack in a similar manner.\n\nIt is said that a clever crew can outsmart the funayūrei by carrying buckets and ladles with holes in the bottom. Despite their efforts the ghosts will not be able to flood the human ship with such tools. Encounters with ghost ships can also be avoided by boldly sailing directly through the phantasm instead of turning to avoid a collision—though this runs the risk that the other ship may actually be real and not a phantasm. Some crews have also escaped the wrath of the funayūrei by throwing food and provisions overboard as offerings to the hungry ghosts, who chase after the food instead of the crew.\n\n",

However, based on its name, it is often believed to be related to kinako; perhaps it is a yōkai who loves to eat kinako, or even a spirit of kinako itself.\n\nOrigin: Kinakobō appears in Hyakki yagyō emaki, a picture scroll painted by Oda Gōchō in 1832. Like the other yōkai in this scroll, kinakobō is depicted with a name and illustration only; no stories or folktales exist. Oda’s kinakobō is also depicted only from the shoulders up, so like its behavior, what the rest of the yōkai looks like is only speculation.\n\nKinakobō’s name comes from kinako, a sweet, yellow powder made from roasted soybean flour—a popular ingredient in Japanese confections since the middle ages. Kinakobō’s skin is the same yellow color as kinako, and with its flabby shape this yōkai somewhat resembles a large kinako mochi. The suffix bō literally refers to Buddhist monks, but it is often used without religious context, meaning something more like “boy.”\n\nKinakobō shares a strong resemblance with another yōkai called kasukurai; however, since both exist in picture form only, it’s impossible to say whether they are separate creatures or different interpretations of the same yōkai.\n\n",

Their eyes are heavy with sultry, sexual energy, and their nearly transparent wet clothes stick to their skin. From the waist up, they appear like ordinary human women. But from the waist down, they are blurry and slightly transparent, betraying their otherworldly nature. In some regions they are said to be large enough to crush ships out at sea, like umi bōzu. They also have the ability to disguise themselves perfectly as large beach rocks when they don’t want to be seen.\n\nInteractions: When iso onna appear on sandy beaches, they look like beautiful women, staring far out to sea. When somebody approaches and tries speaking to them, they turn around and let out an ear-piercing shriek. This stuns their victim. Then they lash out with their long hair and drag their prey into the sea. Once in the water, they drain their victims’ blood with their hair.\n\nOn rocky coasts without sandy beaches, iso onna appear sitting on the cliffs and calling out to passersby in an eerie voice.

They walk off the cliffs and fall to their deaths, leaving the iso onna free to feed on their bodies.\n\nIso onna are occasionally encountered far out at sea.

The name connotes liveliness, a fitting match for the personality of this creature. Due to the orangutan’s physical resemblance to this yōkai, the name shōjō is applied to that species of great ape in both Japan and China. Additionally, shōjō can be used to refer to a person who is a heavy drinker. The famous artist and yōkai painter Kawanabe Kyōsai jokingly referred to himself as a shōjō in this way.\n\n",

Renowned for their size, their vividly beautiful colors, and the large and strong webs they weave, the beautiful jorōgumo are also famous for the cruel destruction they wreak on young men. Written with modern kanji, their name means “entangling bride.” However, these characters were added much later to cover up the original meaning of jorōgumo—”whore spider.”\n\nBehavior: Jorōgumo live solitary lives, both as spiders and as yōkai. When a golden orb-weaver reaches 400 years of age, it develops magical powers and begins to feed on human prey instead of insects. Jorōgumo make their nests in caves, forests, or empty houses in towns. Possessing a cunning intelligence and a cold heart, they see humans as nothing more than insects to feed on. They are skillful deceivers and powerful shape-shifters, usually appearing as young, sexy, and stunningly beautiful women.\n\nInteractions: Jorōgumo’s favorite prey are young, handsome men looking for love—or other favors. When a jorōgumo spots a man she desires, she lures him into her home with promises of affection. He is never seen again. Jorōgumo spin silk threads strong enough to ensnare a grown man so that he cannot escape. They also have powerful venom that can slowly weaken a man day by day, allowing the spider to savor her victim’s long and painful death. Jorōgumo can control other, lesser spiders, even employing fire-breathing spiders to burn down the homes of any suspicious meddlers. They are such skillful predators that a jorōgumo can operate like this for years and years, even in the middle of a busy city, piling up hundreds of desiccated skeletons of foolish young men.\n\n",

Underneath those eyes are fleshy, roughly man-sized bodies. With their eyes closed, they resemble pink lumps of flesh, and are nearly indistinguishable from nuppeppō (which live in a similar habitat).\n\nBehavior: Hyakume make their homes in old temples, guarding them from would-be thieves during the night. During the day, the sky is too bright for their many sensitive eyes. They only come out at night, spending the lighter hours in dark and shadowy buildings where few humans ever go.\n\nInteractions: Hyakume are shy and try to avoid human contact. Should a human come within a few meters of a hyakume, one of its eyes will detach from its body and fly towards the person. The eye sticks to the person’s body for as long as he or she is in the area, keeping an eye out for criminal activity. Eventually the eye will return to the yōkai when they perceive there is no danger. When hyakume feel threatened, they jump out of the darkness in a menacing manner. They are not particularly violent and rely on their size and fearsome appearance to scare humans away.\n\n",

They are a subset of of chimi, or mountain spirit, though they are much more renowned for their nastiness. The term is not a clearly defined one, but in general they are manifestations of the ill will of the mountains and forests, awoken in order to do harm to humans.\n\nInteractions: Jami are truly wicked and harmful towards people. Because there are so many different wicked spirits that can be considered to be jami, there isn’t one particular behavior or danger specifically ascribed to all jami. However, one common trait is that jami are accompanied by sickness. They are capable of possessing and inhabiting human bodies, infecting sickness and disease upon their human hosts.\n\nOrigin: Along with chimi and mōryō, jami first appear in ancient Chinese histories describing the nature spirits that roam the land. As Chinese culture began to influence Japanese culture, these ancient books became known to Japanese scholars, who incorporated their teachings into their own works. When these creatures were included in Japanese bestiaries and records, they became associated with various Japanese evil spirits.\n\nLegends: In the ancient Chinese hagiography Biographies of Divine Transcendents, a wise sage named Ōyō was able to cure sick people by drawing an image of a prison on the ground. He would then call the evil spirits out of the body of his patients. When the spirit came out, it would become trapped in the prison and the patient would be instantly cured of his sickness. The evil spirits trapped this way were said to be jami.\n\n",

Flies and other insects can be quite distracting and troublesome to meditating priests and monks. Swatting and killing even a fly or a mosquito is a sin in Buddhism. Thus, a hossu can be used to gently shoo away insects which land on their bodies or bite them without harming the insect. In addition to their practical use of keeping insects away, hossu are spiritual tools symbolic of warding away demons and anything else that might distract one from focusing on the Buddha.\n\nHossumori appear in Toriyama Sekien’s Hyakki tsurezure bukuro. He references a famous kōan (a Zen question) in which a student asks Zen master Jōshū whether dogs have buddha nature. Sekien suggests that if even a dog has a buddha nature, then perhaps a hossu used for nine years by a Zen master might also realize its buddha nature. The nine years mentioned by Sekien is a reference to the nine years that Daruma (aka Bodhidharma), the founder of Zen Buddhism, spent in meditation.\n\n",

Their bodies are about three meters long, and are thick and round like barrels. They have six legs, and on each leg are six toes.\n\nBehavior: Nomori live far away from human settlements, and are thus quite rare to see. They hunt by coiling around their prey and strangling it, similar to how a boa constrictor hunts.\n\nLegends: Long ago in Shinano Province (present-day Nagano Prefecture), a young man went into the mountains to gather firewood. When he was deep in the wilderness, he stepped on something in the undergrowth. It was a tail! All of a sudden, a humongous snake-like creature leaped forth and attacked him. It had six legs ending in six-toed feet and a long body over ten meters long.  It was as large as a barrel in its middle, and tapered off towards the head and tail. The serpent coiled all the way up around the young man’s neck and tried to bite his head. Fortunately, he had brought a sickle with him. He was able to cut the creature’s throat and kill it, escaping death.\n\nAfterwards, he carved the creature up with the sickle and brought a piece of it back home to prove what had happened. When the young man told his father the story and showed him the meat, his father became angry. The creature must have been a mountain god, he said, and killing would surely bring its curse upon the family! He banished his son from his home. The son moved into a small hut nearby.\n\nBefore long the piece of meat from the creature began to give off a terrible odor. The smell was so foul that the young man fell gravely ill and was unable to leave his bed. A doctor came and gave the man medicine, and bathed him to remove the smell. Almost immediately he began to feel better. When the young man told the doctor about the giant serpent he had seen in the mountains, the doctor replied that it was not a serpent. It must have been a nomori. Just as yamori (geckos) are guardians of houses and imori (newts) are guardians of wells, nomori are guardians of the wilderness.\n\nA few years later, the young man was caught chopping wood in a prohibited area of the mountains. He was executed for this crime. However, among the locals, his execution was rumored to have been the consequence of the nomori’s curse.\n\n",

Several other prophetic aquatic yōkai have been documented as appearing in Fukushimagata to deliver prophetic messages to the people living there. The reports of these yōkai are very similar, and some of them are considered to be different accounts of the same incident.

It didn’t harm anyone, and so a brave samurai named Shibata Chūta approached the light to investigate. He discovered the creature, who told him that there would be a coming bumper crop lasting for five years, followed by a terrible sickness which would wipe out sixty percent of the population.

Unlike normal crabs, it only has six limbs.\n\nBehavior: While their odd appearance makes quite an impression, nothing is known about what kani oni do or how they live. Everything about them beyond their appearance is a mystery.\n\nOrigin: Kani oni comes from Bakemono zukushi emaki, and like the other yōkai found in this anonymous Edo period scroll, no description of them is given beyond an illustration. While many of the yōkai painted in this scroll are based on puns names which allow us to speculate on their nature, kani oni simply means “crab demon” and does not leave much room for interpretation. The blackened teeth suggest the old fashion of ohaguro, which often gave its users a frightful appearance. The spikes on its shell, its tusks, its blue-green color, and its facial hair all give the impression of a classical oni.\n\nThere is a species of crab known in Japanese as kimengani (Dorippe sinica) or “demon-mask crabs,” so named for the markings on their carapace which resemble the face of a scowling oni. They are related to another species of crab with folkloric connections, heikeigani (Heikeopsis japonica), which are named for the markings on their carapace which resemble samurai warriors.

As the paintings do not include any text other than each yōkai’s name, there has been lots of speculation as to the meaning of each name. Several of them appear to be puns.\n\nMeppō in this yōkai’s name is a Buddhist term referring to the absolute truth which is unmoved by any influence from the outside world. Meppōkai is normally written with the kanji 滅法界, and means the world of the Buddha—i.e. the state of peaceful enlightenment where one is free from all worldly desires; or, nirvana. But the word also has a lay meaning which refers to a state of extremity, tremendousness, or outrageousness to the point of absurdity.

From there, they harass people living in the vicinity.\n\nInteractions: When a traveling priest visits such a temple, or when a new priest is dispatched to lead such a temple, the kanibōzu appears before them and demands they answer a riddle. If the priest cannot answer correctly, they are eaten.\n\nOrigin: Several temples are home to kanibōzu legends, including Chōgenji in Yamanashi Prefecture, Yōzenji in Ishikawa Prefecture, Honakiraji in Toyama Prefecture, and Kanpōji (destroyed in 1750) in Iwate Prefecture. The tales vary from place to place, but they usually tell of a kanibōzu who commits evil deeds until it is defeated by a priest—sometimes after a battle. At Chōgenji there is even a stone which is said to bear the scars of the kanibōzu’s claw marks.\n\nThe legend of a riddle-giving crab was popularized in the kyōgen play Kani yamabushi, which helped to spread this legend across Japan.\n\nLegends: Long ago, there was a temple in which priests kept disappearing one after another. Every time a new head priest was dispatched to the temple, they disappeared after one night. Soon, the villagers began to think the temple was haunted. No new priests were willing to go to there, and it fell into ruin.\n\nThen one evening, a wandering priest came to the village. He went from door to door looking for a place to rest, but every one told him to go to the old temple. Completely unaware of the danger, the priest did as he was told and upon arriving at the temple, weary from travel, he fell fast asleep.\n\nThe traveling priest awoke from his dream to a strange sound nearby. Looking up, he saw another priest standing next to his bedside. The priest glared fiercely at him and asked a riddle: “What has eight small legs, two large legs, walks sideways, and has eyes pointing straight towards heaven?”\n\nThe traveling priest thought for a moment, and then replied, “You are a crab!” Then he quickly struck at the strange priest with his staff. Startled by the sudden attack, the strange priest shed his disguise and became a gigantic crab. It scuttled sideways out of the temple. The traveling priest threw his staff at the crab, cracking its shell, but it managed to escape.\n\nIn the morning, the villagers came to the temple to see if the traveling priest was still alive. The priest told them to drain the pond behind the temple, for a yōkai lived inside of it. When the water was drained, they discovered the body of the enormous crab with its shell cracked open. They also discovered the skeletons of all the priests who went missing from the temple.\n\nAfter that, the traveling priest became the new head priest of the temple. And nothing strange ever happened there again.\n\n",

While mujina was once a common word for badger, these days anaguma refers to ordinary badgers while the term mujina is reserved exclusively for their yōkai form. Mujina are frequently confused with tanuki because of their similar size, appearance, and magical prowess. To further complicate matters, in some regions tanuki are called mujina, while mujina are called tanuki. In other regions the term mami applies to both animals.\n\nBehavior: Mujina are less famous as yōkai than other shape-changing animals. As they live in the mountains, generally far from human society, they are not encountered as frequently as other animal yōkai. They are shy, and do not like to be seen by or interact with humans. Unlike other, more careless magical animals, the few mujina who live amongst human society take great care not to betray their true nature in any way.\n\nInteractions: When it is dark and quiet, and there are no humans around, it is said that mujina shift into a humanoid form—usually that of a young boy wearing a tiny kimono—and sing songs in the street. If approached by a stranger, they run away into the darkness and transform back into animal form.\n\nOther forms: The most well-known form mujina take is that of a nopperabō, a seemingly normal human form, but with no facial features whatsoever. They use this form to scare and panic humans who wander mountain or village roads at night time. Because of this, the two yōkai are often confused, and nopperabō are sometimes mistakenly referred to as mujina. However, other animal yōkai also imitate this same form, and there are non-animal nopperabō as well. Care should be taken to avoid misunderstanding.\n\n",

Smaller, adjacent waves make shapes like arms or claws.\n\nBehavior: Namija exist in painted form only and do not have any legends describing their behavior. Whether they are meant to be distinct creatures or just an mysterious oceanic phenomenon is unknown.\n\nOrigin: Namija is one of eleven yōkai appearing in Bakemono zukushi emaki, an Edo period scroll. The creatures in this scroll are not found elsewhere in folklore, and are presented as pictures and names only. No textual descriptions or legends of these yōkai exist, leaving everything about these creatures up for speculation. It may be a personification of an oceanic phenomenon such as a rogue wave—perhaps sent by a sea dragon living beneath the surface.\n\nAlthough namija’s name means “wave snake,” snakes were often considered to be relatives of dragons—much as the word “serpent” in English  refers to real-world snakes and fantastic dragons. Even during the Edo period, the notion that animals transformed from one form into more powerful forms, or different creatures entirely, was a prevalent folk belief. Based on the accompanying illustration and the fact that bodies of water are strongly associated with dragons—such as the dragon king who rules the ocean—it is likely that namija is a meant to represent a dragon and not a snake.\n\n",

Rarely, hitodama materialize when a person loses consciousness, floating outside of the body, only to return when the person regains consciousness.\n\nHitodama are harmless, and it is important not to confuse them with other, potentially deadly fireball yōkai. Hitodama can be distinguished from other hi no tama by the distinctive tails of light which trail behind them.\n\n",

Nekomata are found in cities and villages and are born in the same way as other bakeneko. However, only the oldest, largest cats with the longest tails—and thus the most intelligence—become this powerful variety. When a nekomata transforms into a yōkai, its tail splits down the center into two identical tails. These monster cats are most likely seen walking around on their hind legs and speaking human languages.\n\nBehavior: While not all bakeneko are malicious or violent towards their masters, all nekomata are; they look upon humans with contempt. Nekomata summon fireballs and start great conflagrations, killing many people. They control corpses like puppet-masters with their necromantic powers, and they use their powerful influence to blackmail or enslave humans.\n\nThe most dangerous and powerful nekomata live deep in the mountains, where they prowl in the shape of wild cats like leopards and lions. They grow to incredible sizes, many meters long, and prey on other large animals such as wild boars, dogs, bears, and of course humans.\n\n",

            "content": "地獄\nじごくTranslation: earth prison; hell\n\nAppearance: Souls who are deemed unworthy of rebirth in the five upper Buddhist realms find themselves in the worst afterlife of all—Jigoku, or Buddhist hell. Though it is described as one realm, Jigoku is not just one place. There are countless different hells, which are usually separated into eight hot hells and eight cold hells. These are further subdivided into many other smaller planes and demi-planes—more than 64,000 according to some counts—and each one has a uniquely specialized form of punishment and length of stay, tailor-made to the sins of its inhabitants. While there are many different levels of hell in Japanese Buddhism, the general term Jigoku usually refers to the eight hot hells, also known as the eight great hells. The eight great hells are as follows:\n\nTōkatsu Jigoku, the reviving hell, is the plane of hell reserved for those who commit the sin of killing. Those who kill without remorse go to this hell. Even the killing of lesser creatures such as mosquitoes, flies, or ants—unless repented—will cause a soul to go to this hell. In addition, people who were particularly pugilistic in life, and those who died in mutiny or uprisings will also fall into this hell. Here, the ground is ever hot and burning. Denizens of this hell must fight each other with iron claws, tearing each other to pieces. Terrible oni roam the land, smashing, and pulverizing souls with their iron clubs. As soon as a soul dies, a cool breeze blows and it is instantly revived, and must fight to the death again. Souls here experience the pain of being killed countless times, for a life span in the reviving hell lasts 500 years. However, time in hell is measured differently than in the world of the living: one day in this hell is equivalent to 500 years in the realm of the Four Heavenly Kings, while one day there is equivalent to 50 years on earth. Therefore, a soul in Tōkatsu Jigoku must continue this punishment for over 1.6 trillion human years.\n\nKokujō Jigoku, the hell of black threads, is reserved for those who have not only killed but also committed the sin of theft. Here, oni knock the souls onto the hot ground and mark lines on their body with black threads. Then, using axes and saws, the bodies are hacked to pieces along the markings made by the threads. Others are made to carry heavy piles of hot iron across a tightrope suspended over a giant frying pan. When the victims fall, they are boiled and hacked to pieces in the pan. One life span here lasts a thousand years; however, a day in this hell is equivalent to 1000 years in the realm of Tōriten, while one day in Tōriten is equivalent to 100 years in the human realm. This works out to about 13.3 trillion human years.\n\nShugō Jigoku, the crushing hell, is reserved for sinners who have killed, stolen, and also committed the sin of lewdness. The suffering here is ten times greater than that of Kokujō Jigoku. Denizens here are crushed repeatedly between mountains of iron, being pulverized into a bloody jelly. When the mountains separate, life is restored and the process begins again. Trees with razor-like leaves dot the landscape, and beautiful men and women beckon to the souls from the tree tops. The lustful inhabitants climb the trees, slicing their bodies up in the process, and when they reach the treetops the beautiful men and women reappear at the bottoms of the trees, beckoning them back down. As blood and severed organs spout from the bodies, giant demons and beasts rush in to gobble of their entrails and pound the souls into a bloody mush. Fellators have their tongues stretched out and nailed to their ears. Pedophiles have molten copper pumped into their anuses until it pours out of their mouths. Homosexuals see their lovers covered in flames, and are forced to embrace them, only to be burned and torn into pieces themselves. Souls remain here for 2000 years; however, one day here lasts 2000 years in the realm of Yamaten, and one day in Yamaten lasts 200 human years. Thus, a lifetime here is equivalent to over 106 trillion human years.\n\nKyōkan Jigoku, the screaming hell, is for murders, thieves, lechers, and alcoholics. The suffering here is ten times stronger than in the previous hell. Here, sinners are thrown into boiling pots or locked up in iron chambers and roasted by oni. Those who committed crimes while drunk have their mouths wrenched open and molten iron is poured into their bellies. The cries of anguish of the denizens only serve to anger the oni further, and they fire arrows at the souls or bash them with iron clubs to make them stop, at which point they only revive and resume their suffering. One lifetime here lasts 4000 years, of which one day is equal to 4000 years in Tosotsuten, of which one day is equal to 400 human years. Thus, a condemned soul will spend over 852 trillion years in Kyōkan Jigoku.\n\nDaikyōkan Jigoku, the hell of great screaming, contains murderers, thieves, debauchers, drunks, and liars. The suffering inflicted here is ten times worse than in the previous hell. Here, the tongues of the damned are pierced with iron nails and stretched and torn from their bodies, after which they grow back and are immediately pierced and torn again. This continues for 8000 years, one day of which equals 8000 years in Kerakuten, where one day is equivalent to 800 human years. The damned in Daikyōkan Jigoku suffer for an equivalent of roughly 6.8 quadrillion years.\n\nJōnetsu Jigoku, the burning hell, contains killers, robbers, perverts, drunkards, liars, and those who have held thoughts or beliefs contrary to Buddhist teachings. Here, the tortured souls are beaten with red-hot iron clubs. They have hot skewers thrust through their mouths and out their anuses, and are broiled over a great sea of fire. A life span in this hell lasts 16,000 years, one day of which equals 16,000 years in Takejizaiten, where one day is equivalent to 1,600 years on earth. A damned soul here spends the equivalent of 54.5 quadrillion human years.\n\nDaijōnetsu Jigoku, the hell of great burning, is much the same as Jōnetsu Jigoku, only much hotter. The suffering here is equivalent to ten times more than all of the higher hells combined. This plane of hell is reserved for sinners who have committed all of the crimes listed previously in addition to physical crimes against Buddhist clergy—for example, raping a nun. The screams of the tortured souls here are so terrible that they can be heard up to 24,000 miles away. The power of this hell is so great that those who are to be sentenced here begin to feel their suffering up to three days before they actually die. The punishment on this level of hell lasts one half of an antarakalpa—a unit of time in Indian cosmology that is so unfathomably long that it defies mathematical description.\n\nMugen Jigoku, the hell of uninterrupted suffering, is the eighth and deepest circle of hell. It is reserved for the worst of the worst—murders of their own parents; killers of saints; those who have betrayed every single Buddhist precept. The souls down here are so hungry and thirsty that they tear apart their own bodies and drink their own blood in a useless attempt to ease their suffering. Words literally cannot describe how awful this hell is; if Mugen Jigoku were ever accurately described, both the reader and the writer would die from the sheer horror of it. It is so deep that it takes 2000 years of falling, non-stop, at terminal velocity, for a soul to descend all the way into this hell. Some say that those who are sent here never come back, while others say that the term of punishment here lasts one full antarakalpa, after which the soul may reincarnate again; although, even after a soul is finally released from this hell, its punishment is said to continue on into its next lives.\n\nInteractions: Because Jigoku is so terrible and the buddhas so merciful, the tortured souls in Jigoku are allowed a few more trials like the ones they received in Meido to see whether they can be released from hell early or not—or at least have their existence “upgraded” to a less torturous one. On specific days, Buddhist memorial services are held by the deceased’s surviving relatives. While the specifics of what exactly happens in Jigoku vary between different Buddhist traditions, this is one explanation of the trials:\n\n100 days after death marks the first trial in Jigoku. These trials are not so much judgments, as the soul is already being tortured in hell. They are more like appeals, where the soul (and his or her still-living family) get to appeal to the gods and the buddhas for one more chance at salvation. During the first of these trials, the soul is brought before King Byōdō (whose true form is Kannon Bosatsu, also known as Guanyin or Avalokitesvara in English).\n\nOn the 1 year anniversary of the death, the soul is once again brought to trial. This time the judge is King Toshi (whose true form is Seishi Bosatsu, or Mahasthamaprapta).\n\nOn the 2nd year anniversary of one’s death (the beginning of the third year after death), the soul is granted another chance for salvation by trial. King Godō-tenrin (whose true form is Amida Nyōrai, or Amitabha) presides over this judgment. In Chinese Buddhism, this tenth trial is the last chance for salvation; however, in some forms of Japanese Buddhism the soul still gets three more chances for salvation from Jigoku.\n\nThe next trial occurs 6 years after death, and is presided over by King Renge (whose true form is Ashuku Nyōrai, or Akshobhya).\n\nAnother trial occurs 12 years after death, and is presided over by King Gion (whose true form is Dainichi Nyōrai, or Vairocana).\n\nThe thirteenth and final trial occurs 32 years after death. This last trial is presided over by King Houkai (whose true form is Kokūzō Bosatsu, or Akasagarbha). Those who fail all three of these final tests, either through their own faults or from lack of prayers by their living relatives, are damned to remain in hell for a very, very long time before they can be reborn into one of the five other realms.\n\nOrigin: Like Meido, the Japanese concept of Jigoku derives from Chinese Buddhism—specifically the concept of Diyu, which is in turn derived from the Indian Buddhist concept of Naraka. After being imported to Japan from China, it developed other uniquely Japanese features, although it never merged with the native Shinto concept of hell, Yomi.\n\n",

Long-lived tsuchigumo can transform into yōkai. They grow to a monstrous size, able to catch much larger prey—particularly humans.\n\nBehavior: Tsuchigumo live in the forests and mountains, making their homes in silk tubes from which they ambush passing prey. Like other spider yōkai, they rely on illusion and trickery to deceive people. While the jorōgumo use their sexuality to seduce young men, the tsuchigumo have a wider selection of deceptions—and often bigger ambitions.\n\nLegends: The accounts of the legendary warrior Minamoto no Yorimitsu contain numerous encounters with tsuchigumo. In one, a tsuchigumo changed itself into a servant boy to administer venom in the form of medicine to the famed warrior. When his wounds were not healing and the medicine didn’t seem to be working, Yorimitsu suspected foul play. He slashed his sword at the boy, who then fled into the forest. The attack broke the powerful illusion which the spider had laid on Yorimitsu, and he found that he was covered in spider webs. Yorimitsu and his retainers followed the trail of spider’s blood into the mountains, where they discovered a gigantic, monstrous arachnid—dead from the wound Yorimitsu had inflicted.\n\nIn another legend, a tsuchigumo took the form of a beautiful warrior woman and lead an army of yōkai against Japan. Yorimitsu and his men met the yōkai army on the battlefield. With his experience in such matters Yorimitsu attacked the woman general first. The blow struck, her army vanished—it was merely an illusion. The warriors followed the woman to a cave in the mountains, where she morphed into a giant spider. With one swing of his sword, Yorimitsu sliced her abdomen open. Thousands of baby spiders the size of human infants swarmed out from her belly. Yorimitsu and his retainers slew every one of the spiders and returned home victorious.\n\n",

When the false echo comes from the forest, it is usually attributed to a kodama. When it comes from the mountains, it is due to something called a yamabiko. They are small, appearing like a cross between a dog and a wild monkey.\n\nYamabiko are known almost exclusively by their voices. They are skilled at mimicking any sound, including natural sounds, human language, and trains and cars. They occasionally unleash terrible and mysterious screams deep in the forests that can carry for long distances.\n\nBehavior: Little is known about these yōkai due to their rarity and elusiveness. They live deep in the mountains and make their homes in camphor trees, in close proximity to (and sharing a common ancestry with) other tree and mountain spirits. For many centuries, their calls were speculated to be a kind of rare bird, or other kinds of yōkai, or even natural phenomena. It wasn’t until the Edo period—when determined yōkai researchers like Sawaki Sūshi and Toriyama Sekien began making illustrated yokai bestiaries—that this creature’s form was decided.\n\n",
